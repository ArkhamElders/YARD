## Introduction

Warm, amber light spilled from the windows of the "Dead Troll Inn," promising food and shelter from the icy wind raging outside. There was something magical about that glow, which seemed to pierce the blizzard, guiding frozen Wanderers like a lantern in the darkness. The tavern, as old as the traditions of the northern folk, had long been a place where hunters, merchants, and sometimes shady characters with faces hidden in deep hoods gathered.

The scent of roasted meat, spicy herbs, and freshly brewed dark ale hung in the air, greeting everyone who crossed the threshold. Inside, the hum of conversation was broken now and then by bursts of laughter or the clinking of mugs on tables. The fireplace, large and filled with crackling logs, cast golden light on walls adorned with hunting trophies. Goblin skulls, deer antlers, and the old but still impressive head of a boar reminded all of the hunts that were daily bread for the Yardans.

At one long table, a group of hunters had gathered. A young lad with sparkling eyes proudly recounted how he’d bagged a huge bear that day. “Just try to picture it!” he exclaimed, stretching his arms as if to show the beast’s size. His companion, an old hunter with a face like frozen stone, squinted and retorted, “Will you mention how it nearly drowned you in the river, or skip that part?” Laughter erupted, and the youth fell silent, blushing to the tips of his ears.

In a corner, a dwarf with a beard so thick he could hide half his mug in it sipped something with the look of a man in his element. “Yardish ale is a gift from the gods, I tell you! You won’t find a better brew in my home Tascal, nor in Ofren, nor even in some elven hole!” he bellowed, raising a mug the size of his head. No one argued—why bother? The dwarf spoke the truth, and besides, he could pin down anyone who dared say otherwise with a single move.

A bard played the lute at the bar, and one of the girls danced to the music, spinning like a snowflake in the wind. Her movements drew every eye, especially the younger hunters, who couldn’t look away. Amid the cheerful, homespun chaos, there was a sense of anticipation, and behind it, like a shadow, a hint of unease...

Several older men, instead of joining the fun, sat quietly, gazing out the windows. Their furrowed brows and tight lips suggested something troubled them. Even the wolves, usually content to lounge by the fire, now raised their heads, listening for something human ears couldn’t catch.

When the tavern door finally burst open, everyone froze. A blast of icy wind swept in, along with snowflakes dancing in the firelight. In the doorway stood Kwentu, the old shamaness who, if the tavern tales are true, remembers the mage wars. Behind her walked a huge wolf with jet-black, ragged fur and golden eyes that pierced the crowd. The shamaness threw back her hood and, looking around the room, said:

"The wind in the mountains carries the scent of blood. Wolves howl to Lady Urune, and gryphons are leaving their nests."

Silence fell. The dwarf, who moments before had been joking loudly, set down his mug, stifling a mighty belch. Old hunter Yrn, whose laughter sounded like creaking doors, now stared at Kwentu with gravity.

"If the gryphons are leaving the mountains, that’s a bad omen," he muttered, running a hand through his gray hair. "Those birds don’t fear even the worst blizzard. What could possibly drive them away?"

The shamaness approached the fireplace, shaking ice from her cloak. The wolf padded silently behind her. "I don’t know..." she said quietly, gazing into the fire. "...but whatever is waking in the mountains isn’t anything you know. The wolves dream of old times, of dark magic and a shadow that fell on this land long ago. Lady Urune sends a warning, and we must be ready."

Outside, the wind howled, battering the tavern walls with invisible fists. Flames in the fireplace danced restlessly, as if even fire sensed the coming dread. A few people glanced at the door, fearing something might burst in at any moment. Something is changing. In this tavern, in this forgotten corner of the world, your fates are entwined with shadows soon to hang not only over Yard, but all of Aleor...

## Beginning the Adventure

Kwentu will say plainly that she’s looking for four brave souls to go and find out what’s happening in the mountains. She’ll offer a handsome reward to anyone who helps solve the problem—2 gold pieces and "anything you find along the way." Once the Wanderers gather, they should have a moment to introduce themselves and get acquainted. They can also question locals for clues, learning that there have been more goblins in the mountains lately. Some claim to have seen an ice troll as well.

They should decide whether to set out immediately or wait until morning. Near the inn, they can also buy extra weapons and food supplies, and hire yaks to carry their gear and any loot they find.
