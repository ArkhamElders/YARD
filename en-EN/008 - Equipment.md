# Equipment

Every Wanderer needs solid gear to face monsters. This chapter covers rules for managing inventory space, currency, and lists of available weapons, armor, and spells.

You'll also learn how to increase your carrying capacity, the risks involved, and the purpose of a Home Base.

## Travel Inventory

Your travel pack has limited space for the gear a Wanderer can take on their next adventure. The stronger the character, the more they can carry—calculate inventory space by dividing Strength by 2 and rounding down.

**Example:**

A Wanderer has 15 Strength—divide by 2 to get 7.5, so 7 slots for large items.

Not much, right? Well... a person isn't a merchant's cart; you can't haul four plate armors, fifteen pairs of boots, and two boars.

Luckily, items are divided into small and large. Each small item takes up only half a large slot. Of course, nobody carries arrows loose—quivers hold plenty of ammo. The same goes for healing herbs and potions.

**Example:**

Your character has 7 large (14 small) inventory slots. They carry a bow, a small quiver, leather armor, and two healing potions. The bow and armor each take one slot, the quiver and potions half a slot each. That's 3 used and 4 free large slots in the pack.

## More Luggage

While Wanderers can't carry more than their strength allows, nothing stops you from getting a yak or horse to haul extra gear.

Of course, we don't recommend using a mount in combat—if it dies, nobody will carry your stuff. By default, a mount isn't treated as an Animal Companion in YARD, though it can be if you wish.

A mount's carrying capacity is calculated like a human's—divide Strength by 2.

If a Wanderer wants to ride a loaded horse, subtract 3 points (it weighs a lot and takes up space).

## Purse

New armor, a room at the inn, or a mug of Yardish ale—everything has a price, so it's wise to keep some coins handy. The purse doesn't count toward inventory space, but for safety, don't carry your whole fortune. Every hero starts with ***3d6** x10 silver coins in their purse and can spend the same amount on gear.

The game uses the following currencies:

- Gold – the most valuable metal
- Silver – 100 silver coins = 1 gold coin
- Gems and others – priced individually by merchants

## Home Base

Everyone has a place to return to—a safe haven to rest from the journey and... stash treasures!

You don't have to sell extra gear right away. At home, you can also store shiny coins and gems. They'll be safe there... unless you leave a mountain of gold in plain sight.

This lets you decide what weapons and how much money your Wanderer needs for the next adventure.

## Equipment Tables

Before your first journey, visit a blacksmith or merchant. You don't plan to fight a troll bare-handed, do you?

Here are the most common weapons, armor, and other items found in Aleor. Tables also show typical buy/sell prices from local traders (in silver coins).

Besides standard items, there are also stronger, magic-infused versions and powerful artifacts. Many adventurers have died seeking legendary items—think carefully if you want to be one of them.

Next to each name, you'll find the item's size, helping you manage inventory space.

[M] – Small item
[L] – Large item

Ammo, herbs, potions, and scrolls need special containers or pouches, so they don't have their own size. Nobody sane carries arrows loose.

## Weapons

Below are weapon tables for ranged and melee combat. For ranged weapons, ammo and range are also listed.

Pay attention to the Attributes required to use each item—they're closely tied to the relevant skill. Strength is for melee, while Precise Strike requires Agility.

Also note the standard Condition caused by a critical hit with each weapon/ammo. Sometimes a bow shot can also knock down an enemy. Fate should consider the circumstances and decide.

### Ranged Weapons

|Name            |Range  |Damage  |Attribute|Condition   |Price Buy/Sell    |
|---             |---    |---     |---      |---         |---               |
|Short Bow       |40 m   |1       |[AGI]    |-           |10/5              |
|Long Bow        |80 m   |2       |[STR]    |-           |30/15             |
|Standard Arrow  |-      |2       |-        |Bleeding    |2/1               |
|Crossbow        |20 m   |2       |[AGI]    |-           |30/15             |
|Standard Bolt   |-      |2       |-        |Bleeding    |2/1               |

After a fight, the shooter has 1d4 chances (Fate's roll) to recover ammo from fallen bodies.

### Melee Weapons

The notation `- / STR` means the weapon can also be thrown at a range equal to Strength points. Throwing uses the same attribute as melee for that weapon.

Some weapons require a specific Strength level to use effectively.

|Name          |Range    |Damage  |Attribute|Condition   |Price B/S   |
|---           |---      |---     |---      |---         |---         |
|Club          |-        |2       |[AGI]    |Knocked Down|4/2         |
|Spear         |- / STR  |3       |[STR]>8  |Bleeding    |10/5        |
|Mace*         |-        |2       |[STR]    |Knocked Down|4/2         |
|Dagger*       |- / AGI  |2       |[AGI]    |Bleeding    |10/5        |
|Short Sword*  |-        |3       |[AGI]>10 |Bleeding    |20/10       |
|Long Sword    |-        |4       |[STR]>12 |Bleeding    |30/15       |
|Warhammer     |-        |4       |[STR]>14 |Knocked Down|40/20       |

*Can be used for two-weapon fighting.

## Armor

Besides weapons, it's wise to have armor or a shield to protect your Wanderer from harm. A regular shirt or mage's robe won't help against a blade.

### Types of Armor

|Name              |Armor Points  |Min. Strength  |Price B/S   |
|---               |---           |---            |---         |
|Standard Helmet*  |1             |[STR]>8        |4/2         |
|Wooden Shield     |2             |[STR]>10       |10/5        |
|Leather Armor     |2             |[STR]>10       |20/10       |
|Chainmail*        |4             |[STR]>14       |100/50      |
|Plate Armor*      |6             |[STR]>16       |600/300     |

*Heavy armor and helmets make sneaking and spellcasting harder, giving a Penalty Die to skill tests based on Agility or Intelligence.
