# Introduction

I've been a huge fan of RPGs since childhood, and finally the moment came when I decided to write something of my own. If you're looking for revolutionary mechanics, an original world, and one-of-a-kind heroes... well, you might want to stop reading. I believe that, to a greater or lesser extent, everything in games—and in fantasy more broadly—has already been done. So it's hard to create something truly unique without a few echoes of what's come before. Naturally, as you read this handbook, you'll stumble upon familiar concepts, widely used in games and fantasy. You might even think of places and characters that stuck in my memory too, laying the groundwork for this book. Still, I tried to make this seemingly familiar world different in its own way—and truly my own. I want players to feel at home here, but also driven by curiosity to see what's waiting around the next corner. I hope that as you journey through Aleor, you'll have at least half as much fun as I did writing it.

So what is YARD?
Put simply—it's my take on this genre. Everything I ever looked for in RPGs, and at the same time, my attempt to define my own way of playing, both as a Player and as a Game Master. YARD draws inspiration from the greatest (and some lesser-known) games in the genre, because those are what I grew up with, and they shaped my view of roleplaying. Writing this book, I wanted to create a clear set of rules that wouldn't restrict gameplay—quite the opposite, they're meant to be an accessible guide, letting you experience adventures as freely as possible.

Okay, so I could've just tweaked an existing system for my own needs and never published anything. Sure, but then the writer in me wouldn't let me sleep. Alternatively, I could've set just one rule—"do whatever you want." Sounds perfect, but in its boundless freedom, it leads to... chaos. We all know how creative players can be, and how often they love to bend the rules to suit themselves. Yes, that's one of the most beautiful things about RPGs, but it also demands a lot of flexibility from the GM, which can sometimes be... well, downright exhausting. How many carefully crafted scenarios have been wrecked by party shenanigans? So, I'm siding a bit with all the Game Masters, giving them a system-tool to help them wriggle out of almost any unexpected situation their unruly players throw at them.

I also wanted YARD not to be just another game with a rulebook telling you WHAT you can and can't do. Not one where half the content is tables and calculations. Not one where, instead of just whacking a goblin, you spend half an hour figuring out the best way to attack. That would kill creativity and dynamism—and that's not the point. Instead, I tried to show HOW, using intuitive, easy-to-remember mechanics, you can run the game. Thanks to this, I hope I've struck a balance between player creativity and the GM's need for natural control. But since the easiest way to explain anything is with concrete examples, I needed my own world. I needed Aleor and its people.

Finally... YARD is more than just a fantasy game with a road-trip, swashbuckling vibe. It's a world where tradition and faith clash with science and modernity. A world full of conflicts, prejudices, and intrigues that reach higher than the rulers' influence. Nothing you encounter here is black and white, and the idea of good and evil is always relative. You'll see for yourself when you play the included scenario.

## A Handful of Terms

Like every game, YARD has its own unique terminology. It's worth getting familiar with it right from the start—it'll make reading much easier.

### Fate

Game Master, storyteller, narrator—dozens of names, one role. Why "Fate"? Because it's neither good nor evil, because it's unpredictable and depends largely on the players' actions, because it simply is and waits for Wanderers wherever they go. Fate can be tricky, too, able to change the course of events or the result of a dice roll as many times in a scenario as there are Wanderers. Not necessarily once for each, and not always in the players' favor.

### Wanderer

Hero, adventurer, the character a player embodies while traveling through Yard and the other lands of Aleor.

### Dice of Misfortune and Chance

These are extra d20 dice that can change the outcome of a roll for better or worse. Known in many systems as penalty and bonus dice, they work exactly the same way. If Fate tells a player to roll with the Die of Misfortune, they roll two d20s and take the lower result. With the Die of Chance, they take the higher.

### Breakthrough Points

Points earned for completing story tasks, finding clues, fighting, and showing exceptional creativity during a session. They're the direct way to level up.

### Determination

Ah yes... Let me briefly mention determination. It's a key resource, letting you perform unusual actions, reroll dice, and set the order in combat. In other words, determination is everything that truly drives Wanderers—just like in real life. You'll learn more about how to use it later in the book, but it's something worth paying special attention to, because clever use of determination points will make your game much more interesting.

Enough with the introductions—it's high time to create your first Wanderer. As they say up north: "If you're hitting the road, get a kick to start!"
