# Animal Companion

Having dogs, cats, or even falcons is quite common in Aleor. But the Yardans’ bond with wolves deserves special mention. When the world was young, the Primordial Mother sent wolves to serve the mountain folk, reminding them of her power.

No wolf, nor even a goblin barghest, will attack a Yardan—and vice versa. If a northerner even tries to harm such a creature, they’ll suffer Lady Urune’s wrath (an immediate 20 points of damage, ignoring all armor and protection).

Of course, other Aleor dwellers can tame animals and even use them in battle, provided they have a high enough Animal Understanding (>14). Still, there’s no guarantee a wild beast won’t turn on them. Taming requires passing a test of specific difficulty.

A Wanderer may have only one animal companion at a time. They can attempt to tame another only after releasing the previous one.

## Companion Stats

Animals differ from humans, so their attributes look a bit different. Naturally, they don’t have specialized skills either.

You’ll find detailed stats for each animal in the Bestiary chapter. Here, we’ll focus on the stat overview.

A companion has the following traits:

- Strength
- Endurance
- Agility
- Intellect

Each animal has certain abilities it can use, following the same rules as Wanderers.

Additionally, each description includes hit points, movement range, strength, attack modifier, and armor. In combat, conditions like knockdown or bleeding work just as they do for humans.

Your Wanderer’s Character Sheet has a special section for companion stats.

## Using in Combat

Taming an animal requires passing a one-time Animal Understanding test at the difficulty listed in the Bestiary.

That’s only half the battle—if you want your companion to fight for you, you’ll need a truly strong bond. In other words, your Wanderer must have more than 14 points in Animal Understanding.

Once the bond is formed, the companion’s **[DET]** points match those of its handler. This is because the animal companion faithfully follows its master’s commands. It attacks as an extra party member, acting directly before or after the Hero—the player decides.

Companions, like Wanderers, cannot push their rolls in combat.

## Recovery and Advancement

### Rest

Companions recover endurance and determination much like Wanderers. During a short rest, they regain 3 endurance points; during a full rest, half their endurance and all their determination. However, animals don’t benefit from comforts—they grew up in the wild, and that’s their home. As with Wanderers, an utterly exhausted animal may need a longer rest to fully recover.

### Advancement

Animals have limited learning ability, so their growth is a bit different and closely tied to their handler’s progress. The companion doesn’t gain experience on its own, but for every 5 levels the Wanderer gains, it may increase one chosen attribute and one skill by 1 point.

It also gets a boost to endurance, based on its current Endurance:

- **[END]** < 8 --> +1 point
- **[END]** 8-15 --> +2 points
- **[END]** > 15 --> +3 points
