# Animal Companion

Owning dogs, cats, or even falcons is quite common in Aleor. However, the Yardan bond with wolves deserves special attention. When the world was still young, the Primal Mother sent wolves to serve the mountain folk, reminding them of her power.

No wolf, nor even a goblin barghest, will attack a Yardan—and vice versa. If a northerner even tries to raise a hand against such a creature, they will suffer the wrath of Lady Urune (an immediate 20 points of damage, ignoring all armor and protective barriers).

Of course, other inhabitants of Aleor can also tame animals and even use them in battle, provided they have a sufficient level of Animal Empathy (>14). However, they can never be sure a wild animal won’t turn on them. Taming requires passing a test of specific difficulty.

A Wanderer may have only one animal companion at a time. They may attempt to tame another only after releasing the previous one.

## Companion Statistics

Animals differ from people, so their attributes look a bit different. For obvious reasons, they also lack specialized skills.

Detailed statistics for each animal can be found in the Bestiary chapter. Here, we’ll focus only on presenting the stats.

A companion has the following traits:

- Strength
- Endurance
- Agility
- Intelligence

Each animal has specific abilities it can use under the same rules as Wanderers.

Additionally, each description includes vitality points, movement range, strength and attack modifier, as well as armor. During combat, conditions like being knocked down or bleeding work similarly to how they do for humans.

Your Wanderer’s Character Sheet includes a special section dedicated to companion stats.

## Use in Combat

Taming an animal requires passing a one-time Animal Empathy test at the level indicated by the Bestiary.

That’s only half the battle—if you want the animal to fight for you, a truly strong bond is needed. In other words, your Wanderer must have more than 14 points in Animal Empathy.

Once the bond is formed, the companion’s **[DET]** points match those of its keeper. This is because the animal companion faithfully follows its master’s commands. It attacks as an additional party member, either directly before or after the Hero—the player decides.

Companions, like Wanderers, cannot force rolls in combat.

## Regeneration and Advancement

### Rest

Companions recover vitality and determination much like Wanderers. During a short rest, they can restore 3 vitality points, and during a full rest, half their health and all their determination. However, animals do not benefit from comforts—they were raised in the wild, and that is their home. As with Wanderers, an extremely exhausted animal may need a longer rest to fully recover.

### Advancement

Animals have limited learning abilities, so their development is a bit different and closely tied to the handler’s progress. The companion does not gain experience on its own, but for every 5 levels the Wanderer gains, it may increase one chosen attribute and one skill by 1 point.

It also receives an increase in vitality points, based on its Endurance:

- **[END]** < 8 --> +1 point
- **[END]** 8-15 --> +2 points
- **[END]** > 15 --> +3 points
