# Bestiary

Aleor is home not only to ordinary animals, but also to fantastic and often terrifying creatures. How Wanderers interact with these beings is up to them—not every encounter must end in battle.

Below you'll find sample creatures, mainly used in the introductory scenario. For obvious reasons, there are no stats for humans, elves, or other playable races—these are created just like Wanderers.

Animal and monster stats are just templates, a kind of guideline. The Game Master can modify them as needed. Some beasts also have altered carrying capacity. A wolf or boar, though strong, isn’t suited to being a pack animal.

## Animals and Beasts

### Barghest

These animals were once wolves. Cunningly captured by goblins and forced into servitude, they soon began to resemble their new masters in both character and appearance. Long, pointed, furless ears and a short, upturned snout make the barghest’s head look more like a giant bat. Its wolfish, slightly deformed but muscular body is covered in long, coarse fur the color of stone.

### Boar

Common in Aleor’s forests, prized for their meat and tough hide, especially in the north. They usually avoid people, but when threatened, attack almost instantly. A lone boar isn’t dangerous, but in groups they can be. Many Wanderers have spent a night in a tree thanks to them.

### Gryphon

Majestic creatures, symbols of ancient Yardani wisdom. They nest in caves high among the Howling Peaks. These unique beings, a blend of eagle and lion, understand human speech perfectly, though they cannot speak it. They rarely attack without reason, but it’s best not to cross them.

### Koglak

Huge six-legged beasts resembling white bears. Their legendary frost resistance has led northerners to believe that armor made from their hide grants protection against cold magic. They usually move in pairs (male and female), though groups of up to 10 have been seen. Extremely dangerous, they attack without warning.

## Monsters and Humanoids

### Deogin

Death-bringing wraiths that appear with the mist. Said to be the souls of Wanderers who lost their way. They have no bodies, so no physical attack can harm them, though they seem to avoid fire.

### Digder

Armored monsters the size of a horse, moving on four thick, spider-like legs. Completely blind, they locate prey by sensing vibrations and heat. Near their head, they have an extra pair of strong limbs for digging tunnels and... killing their prey. Their bodies seem made of rock and ore—legend has it a dwarf once forged an incredibly tough armor from a Digder.

STR: 22   END: 20   AGI: 12   INT: 6   WIS: -   CHA: -
MOVE: 16   DET: 4   HP: 21

### Mountain Goblin

Cunning, hunched humanoids with gray skin, a bit stronger than their lowland kin. Though sentient, they’re not very smart, but may know basic shamanic magic. They usually hide in caves, hoarding dubious treasures and gleefully torturing victims. Fighting a goblin? Forget a fair duel—they’ve either set a trap or their weapon is poisoned.

STR: 10   END: 9   AGI: 12   INT: 9   WIS: 8   CHA: 5
MOVE: 10   DET: 5   HP: 9

Skills:
Athletics (8), Something from Nothing (12), Catlike Agility (13)

Control Difficulty: easy

### Ice Troll

Nearly 3 meters tall, known for their gluttony and cruelty. Legend says they were once Yrmins who defied their father, who cursed them into icy monstrosities doomed to eternal damnation. Their backs and faces are covered in thick fur, and their yellow, furious eyes glow menacingly in the dark. Ice horns and spikes grow from their skin, offering extra protection. They’ll eat anything they catch—even a nasty goblin.

STR: 24   END: 20  AGI: 12   INT: 9   WIS: 6   CHA: 4
MOVE: 16   DET: 8   HP: 22

MOD: 3   ARMOR: 4 points (ice armor)

Skills:
Athletics (17), Fury (14)

Control Difficulty: hard

### Talpar

Giant mole-like creatures covered in thick fur, with scaly armor growing from it. They live deep underground and rarely surface, unless drawn by the scent of blood. Unlike their smaller cousins, they’re not blind—on the contrary, they see perfectly, even at night. Both skin and scales make excellent armor components.

STR: 18   END: 14   AGI: 8   INT: 6   WIS: -   CHA: -
MOVE: 11   DET: 4   HP: 16

### Ymirn

Ymirns, also known as ice giants, are said to be the children of Ymir—one of the first gods born of the Primordial Mother, embodying the endless cold of the north. Though cruel, they rarely meddle in Aleor’s affairs, living in small groups high in the mountains.

STR: 20   END: 18   AGI: 10   INT: 10   WIS: 12   CHA: 8
MOVE: 14   DET: 7   HP: 19
