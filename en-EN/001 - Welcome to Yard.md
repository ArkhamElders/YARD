# Welcome to Yard

Far to the north of Aleor, where the world seems to end, lies Yard—a land of rugged beauty, where a hunter and his wolf are worth more than all the gold in royal vaults. Here, in remote regions shunned by most folk, the awe-inspiring Howling Peaks stand guard over the ancient wolf pact. The echo of the First Mother's will still resounds through the endless forests, carried by the song of the icy wind that mercilessly bites into the skin of wanderers. And though most of the world has long forgotten... Here, her presence feels stronger. In barely visible tracks pressed into the snow, in shadows slipping quietly among dense trees, in sun-bleached bones left at the edge of woodland paths.

The North beckons with promises of bountiful hunts, famous Yardish ale, and the craft of local leatherworkers. Yet newcomers quickly learn that Yard does not forgive weakness. Frost gnaws at your bones, blizzards bury villages for days, and only the toughest survive in this merciless land. Many travelers cannot endure and return south before winter truly claims these lands in its icy embrace.

Sparse settlements rise from the earth as wooden, spruce-roofed cottages, blending into the landscape of forests and mountains like shelters for ancient spirits. You won't find crowded streets or the bustle of cities here. Still, Yard's wild face softens a bit in Dofrat, the capital nestled at the foot of the mountains. Bursting with life, it rewards weary travelers with bustling markets, taverns, and workshops—a paradise for merchants of every stripe. You’ll also meet many southern nobles, sending their sons to learn the art of hunting from local masters. Some try to obtain gray wolf pups by trade or trickery—a crime punished most severely in these parts.

You cannot speak of Yardans without mentioning the majestic wolves, living symbols of the land. If legends are true, the First Mother herself sent them here, back when the continent was just beginning to bloom and the only magic known to humankind came from the gods. Winters were longer, forests darker, and the northern folk weaker and lost in a hostile world. Wolves were a gift from Lady Urune... meant to be guides, protectors, and companions. To this day, it’s believed the goddess’s spirit roams the woods in the form of these animals, leading lost wanderers and guarding homes from unwelcome guests.

Though the discovery of crystal magic distanced Aleor from the gods, anyone who sees the northern realm as merely a haven for superstitious hunters and traders is mistaken. This is a place where tradition holds the power of ancient spells, binding people to nature in an unbreakable bond. Only a fool would mock the primal force that rules these lands.

Because of their devotion to tradition, Yardans rarely travel, which means few roads lead in or out. The southern routes connect Dofrat to more civilized regions, while the eastern trails head toward Tascal, home of the dwarves—surprisingly good friends of the wolf folk.

Maybe Yard is your home, or maybe you’re just passing through... One thing is certain—at the foot of the Howling Peaks, your adventure begins.
