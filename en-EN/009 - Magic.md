# Magic

Magic in YARD is common and plays a very important role in the lives of the peoples inhabiting Aleor. While not every resident of the continent needs to be a powerful shaman or mage, most use small prayers and spells to make daily life easier. Magic is divided into two distinct types: shamanic and catalyzed. Both differ significantly, both have their followers, and both shape the fate of this world—even if its inhabitants are not fully aware of it.

The first is much older and comes from the gods, who granted shamans part of their power in exchange for worship. The gods, though gracious, demand absolute obedience and... can be capricious. An inaccurate incantation, haste, or insincere intentions have taught many spellcasters what divine wrath means.

Catalyzed magic is a field of study discovered by humans who were tired of submitting to the will of the gods. They developed a method using amethyst crystals to catalyze the world's energy into magical energy. This discovery allowed them to become independent from the gods and gradually replaced shamanism, accelerating civilization's development in the lands. However, crystals need energy to work and draw it from the wizard's vital forces.

Each Wanderer can use only one chosen path of magic. Only Yardans have no choice—the wolf pact forces them to obey Lady Urune. Of all peoples, only elves can wield both types of magic, as since defeating Madhrat, they are guardians of balance. For this reason, both at the start and during advancements, they can choose one domain from each type.

For all peoples except Yardans, it is possible to renounce divine power or... convert—switching from shamanism to catalyzed magic and vice versa. The Wanderer must simply give up all their previous magic and survive a divine trial. What kind? Little is known except one thing—few who survived it remained sane and healthy.

A mage or shaman who has mastered all domains within a type of magic continues to grow stronger, though they no longer discover new fields. Their spells become more effective—each point of **[ME]** spent (or 2 points for area spells) is 1 additional point of damage/healing/summoning round.

## Spell Cost

Casting offensive spells in YARD is very simple. The Wanderer declares what they want to do and how many points of mystic energy to spend. For a single target, each point of damage means one **[ME]** spent. For area attacks, it's 2 **[ME]** per 10 meters. As with standard weapon combat, conditions are applied on a hard success. Attack chains are also possible here.

Advanced defensive and healing spells (much more effective than herbalism and potions) work similarly. For 1 **[ME]** point, the caster can heal 1 HP. Group healing costs 2 points of Mystic Energy.

Summoning and controlling various creatures works a bit differently. Each has an assigned difficulty level for taming and control. Taming allows building a lasting bond, while control allows temporary summoning. The cost to summon a creature for one round is as follows, depending on control difficulty:

- easy – 1 **[ME]** point
- hard – 2 **[ME]** points
- critical – 3 **[ME]** points

Importantly, the caster must be familiar with the creature and have defeated it in battle or convinced it to help without magic. A wizard or shaman can summon up to 5 allies at once, spending the appropriate amount of energy for each.

Almost identical rules apply to bardic songs, though these do not consume Mystic Energy. Their effect lasts as long as the melody is heard. This partly explains why orcs tend to target enemy bards at the start of combat. A bard busy with a song cannot perform actions other than movement unless they choose to stop playing.

For spells outside combat, leave the Mystic Energy cost to Fate. After all, there's no need to account for every torch lit.

## Shamanism

This is a manifestation of divine power. Shamanic magic is less stable than catalyzed magic. However, it allows unlimited use of nature's benefits during regeneration—all the shaman needs are the right herbs. There's no need for time-consuming preparation of special potions. An additional advantage is that the shaman does not need to learn spells. Their deity sends them as a gift after a successful test. In practice, this means the ability to invent a spell during combat.

A Wanderer wishing to become a shaman must perform a ritual in which they submit to the will of the gods. Then they can choose their first element. Every 5 levels, they can choose another.

When casting shamanic spells, the Wanderer must accept punishment for even the slightest failure. If the incantation fails, the offended deity may, for example, immobilize the Wanderer, inflict disease, or take away some vitality. A critical failure in the test further intensifies the deity's wrath.

A shaman can also gain the deity's favor by praying at camp (during rest). Usually, this is one automatically successful test, resistance to the first attack, or a temporary increase in determination points, though it's never certain what Fate will bring. For every 5 levels, the shaman automatically gains a 5% chance of favor (starting at level five). The favor test is up to Fate, who rolls a d20.

### Shamanic Magic Domains:
- Fire – the oldest field, giving control over flames
- Water – what if you could bring rain or... drain all water from an enemy's body?
- Earth – rocks, plants, and the earth itself are at your disposal
- Air – from a gentle breeze to destructive cyclones
- Ice – they say death by freezing is beautiful, because when a person freezes, they feel warm for a moment...
- Beast Summoning – the power to control creatures to serve the shaman
- Divine Favor – a kind of prayer that can provide advanced healing and various resistances

## Catalyzed Magic

As mentioned, catalyzed magic works based on crystals that literally become part of the bearer. The crystal grows into the mage's body, giving them power in exchange for life energy. The mage chooses their first specialization, then can choose another every 5 levels.

Each time a spell is cast, the wizard pays not only the required Mystic Energy points but also health—2 HP for every 5 caster levels. The mage can ignore the crystal's hunger by spending determination points equal to their level.

Unlike shamans, wizards must prepare potions from herbs to use them. This takes some time, but the extract is stronger and works better (1h per potion). The same applies to creating spells. The mage needs time to develop and test a spell before they can use it. Usually, this is done during rest—the wizard must pass an arcane knowledge test.

Sometimes, while traveling, a mage finds mysterious scrolls filled with old magic. The spells written on them are usually more powerful than standard ones. If the scroll's spell comes from a domain known to the mage, they can learn it. If not, they can cast it once or keep the scroll until they learn its domain. Regardless of whether the mage uses the spell or learns it, the scroll disintegrates after use.

### Crystal Magic Specializations:
- Illusions – manipulating minds and changing perception of reality
- Necromancy – death magic, allowing control over those who have passed
- Fire Magic – similar to that known to shamans, but more predictable
- Essence – unleashes the true power of crystals, some say close to divine
- Darkness – a vile field, full of rot and fear
- Interworld – allows opening gates to other, unexplored dimensions
- Shaping – gives the power to create magical items, buildings, and creatures
