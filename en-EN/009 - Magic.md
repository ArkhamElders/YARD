# Magic

Magic in YARD is commonplace and plays a vital role in the lives of Aleor’s peoples. While not every inhabitant of the continent is a powerful shaman or mage, most use small prayers and spells to make daily life easier. Magic is divided into two distinct types: shamanic and catalyzed. Both differ greatly, both have their followers, and both shape the fate of this world—even if its people aren’t fully aware of it.

The first is much older and comes from the gods, who granted shamans a portion of their power in exchange for worship. The gods, though gracious, demand absolute obedience and... can be capricious. A rushed incantation or insincere intentions have taught many spellcasters the meaning of divine wrath.

Catalyzed magic is a field of study discovered by humans who grew tired of submitting to the gods’ will. They developed a method using amethyst crystals to catalyze the world’s energy into magical energy. This discovery allowed them to break free from the gods and gradually replaced shamanism, accelerating civilization’s development. However, crystals require energy to function and draw it from the mage’s vital force.

Each Wanderer may use only one chosen path of magic. Only Yardans have no choice—the wolf pact binds them to Lady Urune. Of all peoples, only elves may wield both types of magic, as they have been guardians of balance since the defeat of Madhrat. Thus, both at the start and during advancements, they may choose one domain from each type.

For all peoples except Yardans, it’s possible to renounce divine power or... convert—switching from shamanism to catalyzed magic and vice versa. The Wanderer must simply relinquish all their previous magic and survive a divine trial. What kind? Little is known, except that those who survive it often lose their mind and health.

A mage or shaman who already possesses all domains within a type of magic continues to grow in power, though they no longer discover new fields. Their spells become more effective—each point of **[ME]** spent (or 2 points for area spells) grants 1 additional point of damage/healing/summoning per round.

## Spell Cost

Casting offensive spells in YARD is very simple. The Wanderer declares what they want to do and how many points of mystic energy to spend. For a single target, each point of damage costs one **[ME]**. For area attacks, it’s 2 **[ME]** per 10 meters. As with standard weapon combat, conditions are applied on a hard success. Attack chains are also possible here.

Advanced defensive and healing spells (much more effective than herbalism and potions) work similarly. For 1 **[ME]**, the caster can heal 1 Vitality Point. Group healing costs 2 Mystic Energy points.

Summoning and controlling various creatures works a bit differently. Each has a set difficulty for taming and control. Taming builds a lasting bond, while control allows temporary summoning. The cost to summon a creature for one round depends on the control difficulty:

- easy – 1 **[ME]**
- hard – 2 **[ME]**
- critical – 3 **[ME]**

Importantly, the caster must be familiar with the creature and have either defeated it in battle or convinced it to help without magic. A mage or shaman may summon up to 5 allies at once, spending the appropriate amount of energy for each.

Nearly identical rules apply to bardic songs, though these do not consume Mystic Energy. Their effect lasts as long as the melody is heard. This partly explains why orcs tend to target enemy bards at the start of battle. A bard engaged in song cannot take actions other than movement, unless they choose to stop singing.

For spells outside of combat, let Fate decide the cost in Mystic Energy. After all, there’s no need to account for every torch lit.

## Shamanism


This is a manifestation of divine power. Shamanic magic is less stable than catalyzed magic. However, it allows unlimited use of nature’s gifts during recovery—as long as the shaman has the right herbs. There’s no need for time-consuming potion brewing.

A Wanderer wishing to become a shaman must perform a ritual to submit to the gods’ will. Then, they may choose their first element. Every 5 levels, they may choose another.

When casting shamanic spells, the Wanderer must be prepared for punishment in case of even the slightest failure. A critical failure in the test further intensifies the deity’s wrath.

### Shamanic Magic Domains:
- Fire – the oldest field, granting control over flames
- Water – summon rain or... drain all water from an enemy’s body?
- Earth – rocks, plants, and the earth itself are at your disposal
- Air – from gentle breezes to destructive cyclones
- Ice – they say death by freezing is beautiful, because when a person freezes, they feel warm for a moment...
- Beast Summoning – the power to control creatures to serve the shaman
- Divine Grace – a special kind of prayer, granting advanced healing and various resistances

## Catalyzed Magic


As mentioned, catalyzed magic works through crystals that literally become part of the bearer. The crystal grows into the mage’s body, granting power in exchange for life energy. The mage chooses their first specialization, then may select another every 5 levels.

Each time a spell is cast, the mage pays not only the required amount of Mystic Energy, but also health—2 Vitality Points for every 5 caster levels. The mage may ignore the crystal’s hunger by sacrificing a number of determination points equal to their level.

Unlike shamans, mages must brew potions from herbs to use them. This takes some time, but the extract is stronger and more effective (1 hour per potion).

### Crystal Magic Specializations:
- Illusions – manipulate minds and alter perception of reality
- Necromancy – death magic, allowing control over the departed
- Fire Magic – similar to the shamanic kind, but more predictable
- Essence – unleashes the true power of crystals, some say akin to lightning
- Shadow – a vile field, filled with rot and fear
- Interworld – opens gates to other, unknown dimensions
- Shaping – grants the power to create magical items, buildings, and beings
