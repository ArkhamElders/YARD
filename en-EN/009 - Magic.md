# Magic

Magic in YARD is commonplace and plays a vital role in the lives of Aleor’s peoples. It comes in two distinct forms: shamanic and catalyzed. Both are quite different, both have their devotees, and both... Well, read on.

The first is much older, a gift from the gods who granted shamans a portion of their power in exchange for worship. The gods, though generous, demand absolute obedience and... can be fickle. A rushed incantation or insincere intent has taught many spellcasters the true meaning of divine wrath.

Catalyzed magic is a field discovered by humans who grew tired of bowing to the gods’ whims. They devised a method using amethyst crystals to channel the world’s energy into magical power. This breakthrough freed them from divine rule and gradually replaced shamanism, accelerating civilization’s progress. However, crystals require energy to function, drawing it from the mage’s own vitality.

Every Wanderer may choose only one magical path. Only the Yardans have no choice—their wolf pact binds them to serve Lady Urune. Of all the peoples, only elves can wield both types of magic, for since defeating Madhrat, they are guardians of balance. Thus, at the start and during advancements, they may select one domain from each type.

For all but the Yardans, it’s possible to renounce divine power or... convert—switching from shamanism to catalyzed magic or vice versa. The Wanderer must relinquish all previous magic and survive a divine trial. What kind? Little is known, except this: the few who survived it mostly lost their minds and health.

A mage or shaman who has mastered all domains within their chosen magic still grows stronger, though they discover no new fields. Their spells become more potent—each point of **[ME]** spent (or 2 points for area spells) adds 1 extra point of damage/healing/summoning round.

## Spell Cost

Casting offensive spells in YARD is simple. The Wanderer declares their intent and how much mystical energy to spend. For a single target, each point of damage costs one **[ME]**. For area attacks, it’s 2 **[ME]** per 10 meters. As with standard weapons, conditions are applied on a difficult success. Chain attacks are also possible.

Advanced defensive and healing spells (far more effective than herbalism or potions) work similarly. For 1 **[ME]**, the caster can heal 1 HP. Group healing costs 2 points of Mystical Energy.

Summoning and controlling various creatures works a bit differently. Each has a difficulty level for taming and control. Taming builds a lasting bond, while control allows temporary summoning. The cost to summon a creature for one round depends on control difficulty:

- easy – 1 **[ME]**
- hard – 2 **[ME]**
- critical – 3 **[ME]**

Importantly, the caster must be familiar with the creature and have defeated it in battle or convinced it to help without magic. A mage or shaman may summon up to 5 allies at once, spending the appropriate energy for each.

Bardic songs follow nearly identical rules, though they don’t consume Mystical Energy. Their effect lasts as long as the melody is heard. This explains why orcs tend to take out enemy bards at the start of a fight. A bard busy singing can’t take actions other than movement, unless they stop the song.

For spells outside combat, let Fate decide the Mystical Energy cost. After all, there’s no need to account for every torch lit.

## Shamanism

Shamanism is a manifestation of divine power. Shamanic magic is less stable than catalyzed magic, but allows unlimited use of nature’s gifts during recovery—provided the shaman has the right herbs. No need for time-consuming potion brewing.

A Wanderer wishing to become a shaman must perform a ritual, submitting to the gods’ will. Then they may choose their first element. Every 5 levels, they may select another.

Casting shamanic spells comes with a penalty for even the slightest failure. A critical failure intensifies the deity’s wrath.

### Shamanic Magic Domains:
- Fire – the oldest domain, granting control over flames
- Water – summon rain or... drain all water from an enemy’s body?
- Earth – rocks, plants, and the ground itself are yours to command
- Air – from gentle breezes to destructive cyclones
- Ice – they say death by freezing is beautiful, for in that moment, you feel so warm...
- Beast Summoning – the power to command creatures to serve the shaman
- Divine Grace – a special kind of prayer, granting advanced healing and various resistances

## Catalyzed Magic

As mentioned, catalyzed magic relies on crystals that literally become part of the bearer. The crystal fuses with the mage’s body, granting power in exchange for life energy. The mage chooses their first specialization, then another every 5 levels.

Each spell cast costs the wizard not only the required Mystical Energy, but also health—2 HP for every 5 caster levels. The mage may ignore the crystal’s hunger by sacrificing Determination points equal to their level.

Unlike shamans, wizards must brew potions from herbs to use them. This takes time, but the extract is stronger and more effective (1 hour per potion).

### Crystal Magic Specializations:
- Illusions – manipulate minds and alter perception
- Necromancy – death magic, controlling those who have passed
- Fire Magic – similar to shamanic fire, but more predictable
- Essence – unleashes the true power of crystals, some say akin to lightning
- Shadow – a vile field, filled with rot and fear
- Interworld – opens gates to other, unknown dimensions
- Shaping – the power to create magical items, structures, and beings
