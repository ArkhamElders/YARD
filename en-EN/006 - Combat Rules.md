# Combat Rules

Although the times of mage wars are over, combat is still a common occurrence in Aleor. The world is full of beasts, magical creatures, and bandit gangs waiting for wandering adventurers. If you want to become a true hero, you must know how to handle yourself in a fight.

At the start of each combat turn, you must determine the order in which characters will attack. To do this, compare the Determination value of all Wanderers and opponents involved in the battle. The character with the highest **[DET]** points attacks first, and the one with the lowest attacks last. If two or more characters have the same number of **[DET]** points, an additional **3d6** roll decides the order—the higher result attacks first. Importantly, this roll does not affect the Wanderer's Determination points.

Sometimes, a surprise attack occurs. A rogue hidden in the shadows can attack an opponent before combat begins and the order is set. As an advantage, they also gain a bonus die for the attack.

Each turn, a Wanderer can perform two actions, but only one can be an attack:
- move
- attack
- dodge or counterattack
- trick

If only one action is performed at the start of the turn, the character can dodge or counterattack during the round.

## Attack

An attack is simply a skill test to determine if the Wanderer hits the opponent. Depending on the type of attack and weapon, the Wanderer tests Arcana, Precise Strike, or Melee Combat. The level of success also determines the additional effect of the attack:

- Normal success – The Wanderer makes a standard attack
- Hard success – Standard damage + the opponent receives a Condition appropriate for the weapon/spell
- Critical success – Double damage + Permanent condition (requires a specialist to remove)
- Failure – The Wanderer misses
- Critical failure – The attack attempt fails, and the hero faces additional consequences (e.g., weapon damage, injuring a companion or themselves).

Fighting with two weapons requires a separate roll for each hand and a sufficient level of Catlike Agility (over 14 pts)—otherwise, the off-hand attack is made with a Penalty Die.

For ranged attacks, remember that ranged weapons require ammunition and only modify the attack. A better bow helps, but arrows deal the damage.

Skill tests during combat cannot be pushed.

### Attack Chain

Sometimes a player wants to attack several opponents at once or make a series of strikes in one attack. This is possible with an attack chain—a sequence of consecutive blows. How does it work?

The Wanderer makes a basic attack test. If successful, they can spend **1 [DET]** point to make a second attack. If that succeeds, they can continue, paying an increasing cost in Determination points each time.

**Example:**
Basic attack >> Second attack – 1 [DET] >> Third attack – 2 [DET] >> Fourth attack – 3 [DET], etc.

The chain can end voluntarily or by failing a test. In the latter case, the character faces consequences that increase with each attack—from exposure to a direct counterattack, to weapon damage, or... well, that's up to Fate.

Due to the length of incantations and the possibility of area attacks, mages and shamans cannot use attack chains when casting spells.

## Modifiers

YARD features two modifiers related to combat. The first is the strength-based damage modifier, and the second is the armor modifier, simply called armor.

During combat, both attacker and defender apply the appropriate modifiers. More details can be found in the chapter on Armor, Attack, and Attack Modifiers.

## Dodge and Counterattack

An attacked character can try to dodge or counterattack. Both actions are opposed rolls, applicable to both Wanderers and encountered opponents. For a dodge to succeed, the Catlike Agility success level must be higher than the attack's success level. Similarly, for a counterattack, compare the combat skill success levels of both characters.

Note that a standard dodge using Catlike Agility only applies to physical damage. Precise magical attacks cannot be dodged, though exceptionally strong minds may resist them.

Counterattacks in YARD are simple:
- a close attack can only be answered with another close attack
- ranged attacks require a ranged counterattack and apply only to magic (magic can counter arrows and magic, but arrows cannot counter magic)

## Trick

Besides standard actions, improvisation is possible, called a trick. A Wanderer can try to stun an opponent, push them into a chasm, or perform another unusual action during their turn. Due to the wide range of possibilities, Fate should always consider the conditions for a trick.

**Example**
During combat, a hero standing on a higher floor wants to push a heavy barrel onto opponents below. Fate makes the trick's success depend on a successful Athletics test. If the test succeeds and the enemies don't dodge, they take 4 damage and the Knockdown condition.

In other words, a trick is using a chosen skill during combat.

## Escapes and Chases

One possible trick is escaping the battlefield. Not a glorious act, but better a cowardly hero than a dead one. Both escape and chase are resolved with opposed Catlike Agility tests. Additionally, if the movement value difference between characters is 3 or more, the one with the higher value rolls with a Bonus Die.

## Using Magic

Casting spells works much like using weapons. The Wanderer declares what they want to do and then makes an Arcana skill test. Every spell, whether shamanic or crystal-based, requires the appropriate amount of Mystic Energy.

More information can be found in the chapter on magic.

## Conditions

Wanderers traveling the wilds of Yard will be exposed to various negative effects, whether caused by nature or powerful opponents. While most conditions fade over time (about 3 rounds), some may be permanent or require a specific remedy. Below you'll find a description of each effect.

### Knockdown

A strong blow from a hammer or other blunt weapon has knocked many heroes to the ground. A Wanderer can try to stand up during the condition by passing an Athletics test. After the rounds of knockdown pass, the character stands automatically. In both cases, one action from the round must be spent. If the Wanderer is pinned by a rock or heavy furniture, a hard Athletics test is needed. In extreme cases (e.g., leg pinned by a giant tree), help from companions or a critical test is required. Fate decides the situation.

### Bleeding

Slashing and piercing weapons can cause bleeding wounds, leading to slow loss of endurance points and sometimes death. Usually, a bleeding Wanderer loses 1 endurance point per round. To stop the blood loss, the wound must be dressed.

**Example:** An orc deals 8 damage to a Wanderer, causing bleeding. If the character receives help, the blood loss ends before 3 rounds pass. For especially nasty wounds, bleeding is continuous and dressing is required to stop it.

### Blindness

A particularly nasty condition that can even lead to permanent loss of sight. A temporarily or permanently blind person makes all tests at one higher difficulty or with an extra **[MD]**. If, in the case of a critical attack or other test, the Wanderer is completely blinded, restoring sight will require a shaman or high-ranking mage.

### Immobilization

Various spells, traps, or even wild vines can restrict a Wanderer's movement. Usually, this means slowing the character (halving movement range), but in extreme cases, it can lead to temporary or permanent immobilization. You can escape earlier by passing a Catlike Agility test.

### Poisoning

This condition is similar to bleeding, but its removal requires an antidote. Standard endurance loss is 1 point per round, unless Fate decides otherwise. It also affects Strength-based tests, adding a Penalty Die.

### Burning

Standard fire damage causes a loss of 1 endurance point per round, unless the burning is due to an explosion or major fire (2-3 per round). Fate should always determine damage based on the situation.

### Frostbite

When body temperature drops, the Wanderer loses one extra endurance point per round. In extreme cases (e.g., blizzard, falling into icy water), cold damage per round can be 1-3. Frostbite negatively affects Agility-based tests, adding a Penalty Die.

### Shock

Lightning shock deals an extra 1 damage per round (in special cases 2-3) and negatively affects spellcasting and other Intelligence-based skills. The character cannot concentrate enough, so every roll is made with a Penalty Die.

### Death
Death is a risk inherent in a Wanderer's life. Numerous battles, exploring unknown lands, and magical experiments—all can sometimes cost the highest price. Fate should not punish Wanderers with instant death for missing a simple trap or eating poisoned berries, but jumping into a chasm can end tragically. A Wanderer whose vitality drops to zero cannot perform any actions.

However, they can spend all their determination to delay death by one (and only one) turn. This gives the rest of the party a chance to heal them. If no one does or the Wanderer cannot pay **[DET]** points, they die.

Of course, the player can continue the game by creating a new character whose path Fate will cross with the party, who surely won't mind the loot of the corpse.
