# Combat Rules

Though the age of mage wars has passed, combat remains a common occurrence in Aleor. The world is full of beasts, magical creatures, and bandit gangs lurking for stray wanderers. If you wish to become a true hero, you must know how to handle yourself in battle.

At the start of each combat round, determine the order in which characters will act. To do this, compare the Determination value of all Wanderers and opponents involved in the fight. The character with the highest **[DET]** acts first, and the one with the lowest acts last. If two or more characters have the same number of **[DET]** points, an additional **3d6** roll decides the order—the higher result goes first. Importantly, this roll does not affect the Wanderer’s Determination points.

Sometimes, a surprise attack occurs. A rogue hidden in the shadows may strike before combat begins and the order is set. As an advantage, they also gain a bonus die to their attack.

Each turn, a Wanderer may perform two actions of their choice, but only one of them can be an attack:
- move
- attack
- dodge or counterattack
- trick

If only one action is taken at the start of the turn, the Wanderer may perform a dodge or counterattack later in the round.

## Attack

An attack is simply a skill test to determine whether the Wanderer hits their opponent. Depending on the type of attack and weapon used, the Wanderer tests Arcana, Precise Strike, or Melee Combat. The level of success also determines the additional effect of the attack:

- Regular success – The Wanderer makes a normal attack
- Hard success – Standard damage + the opponent receives a Condition appropriate to the weapon/spell
- Critical success – Double damage + Permanent condition (requires a specialist to remove)
- Failure – The Wanderer misses
- Critical failure – The attack attempt fails, and the hero faces additional consequences (e.g., weapon breaks, companion or self is injured).

Fighting with two weapons requires a separate roll for each hand and a sufficient level of Catlike Agility (above 14 points)—otherwise, the off-hand attack is made with a Penalty Die.

For ranged attacks, remember that ranged weapons require ammunition and serve only as attack modifiers. A better bow helps, but it’s the arrows that deal damage.

Tests during combat cannot be forced.


### Attack Chain

Sometimes a player wishes to strike several opponents at once or unleash a flurry of blows in a single attack. This is possible with an attack chain—a sequence of consecutive strikes. How does it work?

The Wanderer makes a basic attack test. If successful, they may spend **1 [DET]** point to make a second attack. If that succeeds, they may continue, paying an increasing cost in Determination points each time.

**Example:**
Basic attack >> Second attack – 1 [DET] >> Third attack – 2 [DET] >> Fourth attack – 3 [DET], and so on.

The chain may end voluntarily or due to a failed test. In the latter case, the character faces consequences that grow with each attack—from exposure to a direct counterattack, to weapon damage, or... well, let Fate decide.

Due to the time needed for incantations and the ability to create area attacks, mages and shamans cannot use attack chains when casting spells.

## Modifiers

YARD features two modifiers related to combat. The first is the strength-based damage modifier, and the second is the armor modifier, simply called armor.

During combat, both attacker and defender apply the appropriate modifiers. More details can be found in the Armor, Attack, and Attack Modifier chapter.

## Dodge and Counterattack

A character under attack may attempt to dodge or counterattack. Both actions are opposed rolls, applicable to both Wanderers and encountered foes. For a dodge to succeed, the Catlike Agility success level must be higher than the attack’s success level. Similarly, for a counterattack, compare the combat skill success levels of both characters.

Note that a standard dodge using Catlike Agility only applies to physical damage. Precise magical attacks cannot be dodged, though exceptionally strong minds may resist them.

Counterattacks in YARD are straightforward:
- a close attack can only be answered with another direct attack
- ranged attacks require a ranged counterattack and apply only to magic (magic can counter arrows and magic, but arrows cannot counter magic)

## Trick

Beyond standard actions, improvisation is possible, known as a trick. A Wanderer may attempt to stun an opponent, push them off a ledge, or perform another unusual action during their turn. Given the wide range of possibilities, Fate should always consider the conditions for a trick. Examples of such actions can be found in some skill descriptions.

**Example**
During combat, a hero standing on an upper floor wishes to push a heavy barrel onto enemies below. Fate makes the trick’s success dependent on a successful Athletics test. If the test succeeds and the enemies fail to dodge, they take 4 damage and gain the Knocked Down condition.

In other words, a trick is using a chosen skill during combat.

## Escapes and Chases

One possible trick is escaping the battlefield. Not the most glorious act, but better a cowardly hero than a dead one. Both escape and pursuit are resolved with opposed Catlike Agility tests. Additionally, if the difference in movement values between characters is 3 or more, the one with the higher value rolls with a Bonus Die.

## Using Magic

Casting spells works much like using weapons. The Wanderer declares their intent, then makes an Arcana skill test. Every spell, whether shamanic or crystal-powered, requires a sufficient amount of Mystic Energy.

More information can be found in the chapter dedicated to magic.

## Conditions

Wanderers traveling the wilds of Yard will face various negative effects, whether from nature or powerful foes. While most conditions fade with time (about 3 rounds), some may be permanent or require a specific remedy. Below are descriptions of each effect.

### Knocked Down

A strong blow from a hammer or blunt weapon has felled many a hero. A Wanderer may attempt to stand during the condition by passing an Athletics test. After the rounds of being knocked down pass, the character stands automatically. In both cases, one action from the round must be spent. If the Wanderer is pinned (e.g., by a rock or heavy furniture), a hard Athletics test is required. In extreme cases (e.g., leg trapped by a massive tree), help from companions or a critical test is needed. Fate decides the outcome.

### Bleeding

Slashing and piercing weapons can cause bleeding wounds, leading to slow loss of endurance points, and sometimes even death. In most cases, a bleeding Wanderer loses 1 endurance point per round. To stop the blood loss, the wound must be treated.

**Example:** An orc deals 8 damage to a Wanderer, causing bleeding. If the player’s character receives help, the blood loss ends before 3 rounds pass. For especially nasty wounds, bleeding is continuous and bandaging is required to stop it.

### Blinded

A particularly nasty condition, which can even lead to permanent loss of sight. A person who is temporarily or permanently blind makes all tests at one higher difficulty or with an additional **[MD]**. If, due to a critical attack or other test, a Wanderer is completely blinded, restoring sight will require a shaman or high-ranking mage.

### Immobilized

Various spells, traps, or wild vines can restrict a Wanderer’s movement. Usually, this condition means slowed movement (range reduced by half), but in extreme cases, it can lead to temporary or permanent immobilization. You can escape earlier by passing a Catlike Agility test.

### Poisoned

This condition is similar to bleeding, but removing it requires an antidote. Standard endurance loss is 1 point per round, unless Fate decides otherwise. It also affects strength-based tests, adding a Misfortune Die.

### Burning

Standard fire damage causes a loss of 1 endurance point per round, unless the burning is due to an explosion or major fire (2-3 per round). Fate should always determine the damage based on the situation.

### Frostbitten

When body temperature drops, a Wanderer loses an extra endurance point each round. In extreme cases (e.g., blizzard, falling into icy water), cold damage per round may be 1-3. Frostbite negatively affects agility-based tests, adding a Misfortune Die.

### Shocked

Lightning shock deals an extra 1 damage per round (in rare cases, 2-3) and negatively affects spellcasting and other intelligence-based skills. The character cannot concentrate properly, so every roll is made with a Misfortune Die.

### Death
Death is a risk every Wanderer faces. Countless battles, exploring unknown lands, and magical experiments—all can sometimes cost the ultimate price. While Fate should not punish Wanderers with instant death for missing a simple trap or eating poisoned berries, a leap into an abyss may end tragically. A Wanderer whose vitality drops to zero cannot take any action.

However, they may spend all their determination to delay death by one (and only one) turn. This gives the rest of the party a chance to heal them. If no one does so, or the Wanderer cannot pay with **[DET]** points, they die.

Of course, the player may continue the adventure by creating a new character, whose path Fate will cross with the party—who surely won’t turn down the loot of the fallen.
