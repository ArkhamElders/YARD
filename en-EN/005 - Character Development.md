# Character Development

Journeys across Aleor, battles with monsters, and interactions with encountered characters mean that even a beginner adventurer has a chance to become a great hero one day. Over time, they gain experience and develop skills, becoming a master in their field. For this purpose, experience points and Wanderer levels have been introduced, which clearly illustrate your character's progress. With each new level, the Wanderer becomes stronger and their skills increase. Below you'll find information on how to gain experience and advance to the next level.

## Experience – Breakthrough Points

Every defeated opponent and acquired information is a reward not only in the form of silver and gold coins or new, better equipment. Above all, it's experience that makes your hero grow stronger. In YARD, you won't find typical experience points—instead, there's the concept of **Breakthrough**—a key moment during gameplay for which players can earn Breakthrough Points. To advance to the next level, you need 5 points each time. Fate decides when and for what players are rewarded. It could be a skirmish, obtaining valuable information, or completing a side quest.

### Combat

Defeating an opponent is undoubtedly the best way to develop combat skills. Every beast, monster, or other demon is a challenge. At least at the first encounter, when the fight is usually demanding. A tenth-level party shouldn't have trouble defeating a few goblins, and it's hard to talk about development here.

Breakthrough Points are not divided among party members—regardless of the number of players, after completing a specific task, each character receives a Breakthrough Point, bringing them closer to the next level.

### Interactions and Story Quests

Although combat is a good way to earn points, discovering clues and completing assigned tasks is their most valuable source. Sometimes it may turn out that a quest can be completed without drawing a weapon. Such a solution also deserves a reward. This way, the GM can also reward exceptional player creativity, while saving everyone (especially themselves) from tedious experience point calculations and unnecessary scaling in later stages of the game.

## Breakthroughs – Advancement

As mentioned, each advancement requires five Breakthrough Points. That's it.

There are two types of advancements—minor and major. Minor advancements concern standard level-ups, while major ones are milestones in the hero's development and occur every five levels (5, 10, 15, etc.).

### Minor Advancement

Next to skills on character sheets are dots used to mark success in a test. When advancing to the next level, a Wanderer can increase one of these skills by **1 point**. Each advancement also increases vitality and mystic energy points. Depending on the value of the **[END]** (for vitality) and **[WIS]** (for mystic energy) attributes, their value increases as follows:

**[END]** / **[WIS]** < 8 – +1 pt
**[END]** / **[WIS]** 8-15 – +2 pts
**[END]** / **[WIS]** > 15 – +3 pts

**Example:**
A character with 12 endurance and 6 wisdom gains 2 endurance points and 1 mystic energy point per level.

### Major Advancement

Every five levels, a Wanderer can increase one chosen attribute by **1 point** and increase their total determination points by 2. Note that attribute development affects the base level of basic skills and, in the case of Strength, carrying capacity. It also allows the use of more powerful weapons, which have a required base level of Strength / Agility / Intelligence.

Elves, if they choose to develop both shamanic and catalyzed magic, select one additional domain from each type during major advancement. For example, a shamanic fire element and necromancy, which is the domain of crystal magic.

Of course, during major advancement, the standard character development from minor advancement is also performed.

Few Wanderers exceed human limits, but increasing attributes above 20 points is temporarily possible, both through spells and special mage potions.

## Training with Masters

Sometimes a Wanderer wants to learn new skills they previously knew nothing about. In Aleor's cities, you can meet many masters willing to share a bit of their knowledge... How does it work in practice?

Training duration equals the level of the skill being acquired, and its cost is a thousand times the level, expressed in silver.

For example, to gain level 2 in Catlike Agility, a Wanderer must train under a master for two days and pay 2000 silver coins. Advancing to level 3 takes another three days and costs an additional 3000 silver coins. You cannot jump directly from level 1 to 3 or higher.

In exceptional circumstances (usually resulting from the scenario), Fate may make training cheaper or even free—for example, as a reward for completing a quest. However, to avoid "buying stats," training should be possible up to level 5 at most. The rest Wanderers must learn on their own.

## Sparks

A Wanderer with at least 15 points in a given attribute can try to acquire one of the corresponding Sparks—skills that give a significant bonus in the game. Each additional attribute point unlocks the next (15 pts – one spark, 16 pts – two, 17 pts – three, etc., up to a maximum of 20 pts).

**Example:**
A party in a cave sees a large group of goblins approaching. Their numerical advantage is overwhelming; the Wanderers have no chance in direct combat. One of them, a shaman named Vayler, notices many stalactites hanging from the cave ceiling. He decides to throw a fireball at them, hoping they'll fall and neutralize at least some of the enemies.

Vayler rolls Arcana... the die shows 1—a critical. The goblins are crushed by falling rocks. A clever solution with a bit of luck deserves a reward. Vayler can choose which Intelligence Spark to unlock.

### Strength Sparks

> **Wolf's Blood**
>
> During the full moon, the Wanderer's blood flows faster, and their body yearns for battle. Although their natural strength doesn't increase, they can deal more damage (+2 MOD). The moon's influence is so strong that the Spark works indoors and underground.

> **Fury (I-III)**
>
> Where ordinary strength isn't enough, fury appears. In one chosen round of combat, the Wanderer can deal double damage. To do this, declare fury before attacking and spend 1 **[DET]** point. Acting in rage has its price—even if the test succeeds, an odd die result means the Wanderer attacked blindly, injuring the nearest party member (within max 4m).
>
> Fury is a Spark that can be developed by choosing it again when possible. This extends the rage by another round (up to three), for an additional Determination point.

### Endurance Sparks

> **Not Today, Not Ever**
>
> Once per full moon (once a month), the Wanderer can declare use of this ability. Until the end of the current combat, their Vitality Points never drop below 1—no matter how much damage they take. The ability acts as a shield: instead of losing consciousness or dying, the hero stays alive, though they may be on the brink of exhaustion.

> **Like Water Off a Duck's Back**
>
> The Wanderer gains partial resistance to a chosen condition (e.g., Poison, Burning, etc.). From now on, all damage or penalties from this condition are reduced by 1 point. The Wanderer can still notice the effects (e.g., scorched skin), but they "roll off"... like water off a duck's back. The chosen condition cannot be changed during the game, nor can the same Spark be chosen again for a different condition.

### Agility Sparks

> **Faster Than Himself**
>
> The Wanderer's movements seem to outpace their thoughts, and opponents see only a dancing blade. Once per combat, the Wanderer can unleash their primal speed to gain an extra attack action in any round they choose.

> **Miss!**
>
> The attacked player can automatically dodge a blow by spending Determination points equal to the attacker's success level.

### Intelligence Sparks

> **On Fate's Tab**
>
> When choosing this spark, the shaman/mage assigns one known spell to it. In each combat, they can cast it ONCE without spending Mystic Energy points. After all, they've cast it so many times and know it so well that the words come almost automatically. Sometimes Fate is kind.

> **Spell Absorption**
>
> For Determination points equal to the opponent's success level, the Wanderer can completely negate a magical attack without a test. This can be used not only for themselves but also for a party member.

### Wisdom Sparks

> **Written in the Stars**
>
> Once per moon phase (once a week), the Wanderer can look at the sky and read the answer to any question from the stars. Fate must answer truthfully, though it may do so in an indirect way. The question may concern the right path, hidden dangers, or the true intentions of an encountered character. Condition: the sky must be clear and full of stars.

> **Divine Support**
>
> The shaman spends 2 **[DET]** points, then draws a magic circle on the ground, where ancient energy accumulates through prayer. If the roll succeeds, the deity blesses the shaman, doubling the damage/healing result.
>
> *Failure brings the deity's wrath in the form of half the base roll's damage.*

### Charisma Sparks

> **My Friend...**
>
> Irresistible charisma and charm allow the Wanderer, once every 3 days, to influence any humanoid character to change their attitude. An enemy becomes neutral, and an indifferent guild leader suddenly becomes friendly. However, this is not a permanent state, and further actions may worsen relations again. This spark does not work on undead.

> **Let Me Play Something (I-III)**
>
> A bard's song can inspire companions to fight, giving them a Lucky Die. It can also effectively disrupt the concentration of the party's opponents (Unlucky Die). The Wanderer simply declares a specific song and spends 1 **[DET]** point to support allies or weaken the enemy in one chosen turn of each combat.
>
> This spark can be developed to extend the song's duration (up to 3 turns), using additional determination points.
