# Character Advancement

Traveling through Aleor, battling monsters, and interacting with encountered characters means that even a rookie adventurer has a chance to become a great hero one day. Over time, they'll gain experience and develop their skills, becoming a master in their field. To represent this, experience points and Wanderer levels have been introduced, providing a clear way to track your character's progress. With each new level, your Wanderer grows stronger and their skills improve. Below you'll find information on how to gain experience and level up.

## Experience – Breakthrough Points

Every defeated foe and discovered clue is a reward—not just in silver and gold coins or new, better gear, but most importantly in experience, which makes your hero grow stronger. In YARD, you won't find typical experience points—instead, there's the concept of a **Breakthrough**—a key moment in the game for which players can earn Breakthrough Points. You need 5 points to level up. Fate decides when and for what players are rewarded. It could be a battle, finding valuable information, or completing a side quest.

### Combat

Defeating an opponent is undoubtedly the best way to develop combat skills. Every beast, monster, or demon is a challenge—at least the first time, when the fight is usually tough. A tenth-level party shouldn't have trouble with a few goblins, so there's little growth there.

Breakthrough Points are not split among party members—regardless of the number of players, after completing a specific task, each character gets a Breakthrough Point, bringing them closer to leveling up.

### Interactions and Story Quests

While combat is a good way to earn points, discovering clues and completing assigned tasks is the most valuable source. Sometimes, a quest can be completed without drawing a weapon. Such solutions also deserve a reward. This way, the GM can also reward exceptional player creativity, while saving everyone (especially themselves) from tedious experience calculations and unnecessary scaling in later stages of the game.

## Leveling Up

As mentioned, each level-up requires five Breakthrough Points. That's it.

There are two types of level-ups—minor and major. Minor level-ups are for standard progression from level to level, while major level-ups are milestones in a hero's development, occurring every five levels (5, 10, 15, etc.).

### Minor Level-Up

Next to skills on the character sheet are dots for marking test successes. When leveling up, a Wanderer can increase one of these skills by **1 point**. Each level-up also increases Vitality and Mystic Energy. Depending on your **[CON]** (for Vitality) and **[WIS]** (for Mystic Energy), their values increase as follows:

**[CON]** / **[WIS]** < 8 – +1 point
**[CON]** / **[WIS]** 8–15 – +2 points
**[CON]** / **[WIS]** > 15 – +3 points

**Example:**
A character with 12 Constitution and 6 Wisdom gains 2 Vitality and 1 Mystic Energy per level.

Additionally, each level-up is a chance to learn a new spell. Wanderers have full freedom of choice, but must remember that they may be too weak to use some spells (not enough **[ME]** points).

More about magic and shamanism can be found later in the handbook.

### Major Level-Up

Every five levels, a Wanderer can increase one chosen attribute by **1 point** and raise their total determination points by 2. Note that attribute growth affects the base level of core skills and, in the case of Strength, carrying capacity. It also allows the use of more powerful weapons, which require a minimum level in Strength/Agility/Intelligence.

Elves, if they choose to develop both shamanic and arcane magic, pick one extra domain from each type during a major level-up. For example, a shaman can gain access to the fire element, and necromancy (a crystal magic domain).

Of course, a major level-up also includes the standard improvements from a minor level-up.

Few Wanderers exceed human limits, but raising attributes above 20 points is temporarily possible, through spells or special mage potions.
