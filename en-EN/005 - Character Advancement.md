# Character Advancement

Journeys across Aleor, battles with monsters, and interactions with encountered characters mean that even a fledgling adventurer has a chance to one day become a legendary hero. Over time, they gain experience and hone their skills, becoming a master of their craft. To represent this growth, experience points and Wanderer levels have been introduced, providing a clear measure of your character’s progress. With each new level, a Wanderer grows stronger and their skills improve. In the following sections, you’ll find information on how to earn experience and advance to the next level.

## Experience – Breakthrough Points

Every defeated foe and discovered secret is a reward—not just in silver and gold, or new, better equipment. Above all, it’s experience that makes your hero grow in power. In YARD, you won’t find typical experience points—instead, there is the concept of a **Breakthrough**—a key moment in the adventure for which players can earn Breakthrough Points. To advance to the next level, you need 5 points each time. Fate decides when and for what players are rewarded. It could be a battle, uncovering valuable information, or completing a side quest.

### Combat

Defeating an opponent is undoubtedly the best way to develop combat skills. Every beast, monster, or demon presents a challenge—at least the first time, when the fight is usually demanding. A party at level ten shouldn’t have trouble dispatching a few goblins, and it’s hard to call that growth.

Breakthrough Points are not divided among party members—regardless of the number of players, after completing a specific task, each character receives a Breakthrough Point, bringing them closer to the next level.

### Interactions and Story Quests

While combat is a good way to earn points, uncovering clues and completing assigned tasks is their most valuable source. Sometimes, a quest can be completed without drawing a weapon. Such solutions also deserve a reward. In this way, the GM can reward exceptional player creativity, while sparing everyone (especially themselves) the tedious calculation of experience points and unnecessary scaling in later stages of the game.

## Breakthroughs - Advancements

As mentioned, each advancement requires five Breakthrough Points. That’s it.

There are two types of advancement—minor and major. Minor advancements cover standard level-ups, while major ones mark a milestone in the hero’s development and occur every five levels (5, 10, 15, etc.).

### Minor Advancement

Next to skills on the character sheet are dots used to mark success in a test. When advancing to the next level, a Wanderer may increase one of these skills by **1 point**. Each advancement also increases vitality and mystic energy. Depending on the value of the **[END]** (for vitality) and **[WIS]** (for mystic energy) attributes, their value increases as follows:

**[END]** / **[WIS]** < 8 – +1 point
**[END]** / **[WIS]** 8-15 – +2 points
**[END]** / **[WIS]** > 15 – +3 points

**Example:**
A character with 12 Endurance and 6 Wisdom gains 2 points of vitality and 1 point of mystic energy per level.

### Major Advancement

Every five levels, a Wanderer may increase one chosen attribute by **1 point** and raise their total determination points by 2. Note that attribute growth affects the base level of basic skills and, in the case of Strength, carrying capacity. It also allows the use of more powerful weapons, which have minimum required levels of Strength / Agility / Intelligence.

Elves, if they choose to develop both shamanic and catalyzed magic simultaneously, select one additional domain from each type during a major advancement. For example, a shamanic element like fire and necromancy, which is the domain of crystal magic.

Of course, during a major advancement, the standard character development from a minor advancement is also performed.

Few Wanderers surpass the limits of human capability, but increasing attributes above 20 points is temporarily possible, both through spells and special mage potions.

## Training Under the Masters

Sometimes a Wanderer wishes to learn new skills he previously knew nothing about. In the cities of Aleor, one can find many masters willing to share a bit of their wisdom… But how does it work in practice?

The duration of training equals the level of the skill being learned, and its cost is a thousand times the level, paid in silver.

For example, to reach level 2 in Catlike Agility, a Wanderer must train under a master for two days and pay 2,000 silver coins. Advancing to level 3 will take another three days and cost an additional 3,000 silver. There is no way to jump directly from level 1 to level 3 or higher.

In exceptional circumstances (usually dictated by the story), Fate may allow training to be cheaper or even free—perhaps as a reward for completing a quest. However, to avoid “buying stats,” training should only be possible up to level 5. Beyond that, Wanderers must learn on their own.

## Sparks

A Wanderer with at least 15 points in a given attribute may attempt to gain one of the corresponding Sparks—passive abilities that grant a permanent bonus in the game. Each additional attribute point unlocks another Spark (15 points—one Spark, 16 points—two, 17 points—three, and so on, up to a maximum of 20 points).

However, simply having the required attribute value is not enough to gain a passive ability. Sparks are, in a sense, a reward granted by Fate for exceptional achievements and engagement. Sometimes this might be a series of critical successes, other times a creative solution to a difficult situation, or executing a long chain of attacks.

**Example:** 

The party, deep in a cave, spots a large group of approaching goblins. Their numbers are overwhelming, and the Wanderers stand no chance in a direct fight. One of them, a shaman named Vayler, notices numerous stalactites hanging from the rocky ceiling. He decides to hurl an explosive fireball at them, hoping the falling rocks will neutralize at least some of the enemies.

Vayler rolls for Arcana... the die shows 1—critical success. The goblins are crushed by the falling stalactites. A clever solution with a bit of luck deserves a reward. Vayler may choose which Intelligence Spark to unlock.
