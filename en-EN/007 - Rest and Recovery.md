# Rest and Recovery

Even the bravest Wanderers need rest, or they won’t be able to fight effectively. It’s a time to eat in peace or simply catch their breath before the next challenge. When camping in the wild without any shelter, Wanderers must pass a Survival test; otherwise, recovery is not possible.


There are two types of rest:

### Short Rest

A brief pause to catch your breath on the trail. Not the best solution, but... better than nothing. During a short rest, Wanderers can recover 3 points of vitality.

### Full Rest

Several hours of respite or simply a night’s sleep. This allows you to recover half your vitality points and the same amount of mystic energy points. During a full rest, Wanderers also regain all their determination.

Fate should consider the condition of especially exhausted Wanderers on the brink of death. Their full recovery may be more demanding. Remember, lost limbs rarely regrow on their own.


## Comforts

Undoubtedly, not only time but also the quality of rest matters. Wanderers recover much better when sleeping in a warm, comfortable inn rather than under the open sky. A good, hearty meal also makes a difference.

Depending on the quality of comforts, Fate may grant heroes 1-3 additional points of regeneration for **[VP]** and **[ME]**.

**Example:**

The Wanderers set up camp in the forest. It’s not very comfortable, as they’re unprepared—sleeping under the open sky. However, they find a dry, wind-sheltered cave (+1 point) and hunt a boar to fill their bellies (+6 points). Thanks to this, they recover more **[VP]** and **[ME]**.

Of course, nothing prevents them from using potions or spells to further increase the number of points regained.


## Interrupted Rest

When camping in the wild, Wanderers must be prepared for their rest to be interrupted. An avalanche descending from the mountains or a gang of bandits looking for easy loot—danger always lurks for travelers.

Every rest in nature carries a 25% risk of interruption. Fate rolls **1d4**—if the result is 1, the Wanderers must face a threat, resolved as a surprise attack.

In such cases, they do not recover vitality, mystic energy, or determination. However, nothing prevents them from trying to rest again.


## Fatigue

Battling beasts and long journeys are exhausting—anyone who’s climbed the Howling Peaks knows this well. Wanderers simply must rest, or they’ll be too tired to face the next ice troll.

In YARD, one full rest per day is required. Otherwise, each additional day without respite, Wanderers begin with an extra Misfortune Die for all Endurance (END)-based rolls (dice accumulate).

The most determined Wanderers may ignore penalty dice by sacrificing an equal number of determination points.

**Example:**

- 1 day without rest – 1 Misfortune Die / 1 **[DET]** point
- 2 days – 2 misfortune die / 2 **[DET]** points
- 3 days – 3 misfortune die / 3 **[DET]** points
