# Rest and Recovery

Even the bravest Wanderers need rest; otherwise, they won't be able to fight effectively. It's a time to eat in peace or simply catch their breath before the next challenge. When camping in the wild without any tent, Wanderers must pass a Survival test—otherwise, recovery isn't possible.

There are two types of rest:

### Short Rest

A brief pause to catch your breath on the trail. Not the best option, but... better than nothing. During a short rest, Wanderers can recover 3 points of Vitality.

### Full Rest

A few hours of respite or simply a good night's sleep. This restores half of your Vitality points and the same amount of Mystic Energy. During a long rest, Wanderers also regain all their Determination.

Fate should consider the condition of especially exhausted Wanderers who are on the brink of death. Their full recovery may be more demanding. Also, remember that lost limbs usually don't grow back on their own.

## Comforts

It's not just time, but also the quality of rest that matters. Wanderers recover much better when sleeping in a warm, comfortable inn rather than under the open sky. A good, hearty meal also makes a difference.

Depending on the quality of comforts, Fate may grant heroes 1–3 extra points of recovery for **[VP]** and **[ME]**.

**Example:**

Wanderers set up camp in the forest. It's not very comfortable, since they're unprepared—sleeping under the open sky. However, they find a dry, wind-sheltered cave (+1 point) and hunt a boar to fill their bellies (+6 points). Thanks to this, they recover more **[VP]** and **[ME]**.

Of course, nothing stops them from using potions or spells to further increase the number of points regained.

## Interrupted Rest

When camping in the wild, Wanderers must expect that someone or something might interrupt their rest. An avalanche from the mountains or a gang of common bandits looking for easy loot—you never know what dangers await travelers.

Every rest in the wilderness has a 25% chance of being interrupted. Fate rolls a **1d4**—if the result is 1, Wanderers must face a threat, resolved as a surprise attack.

In this case, they do not recover Vitality, Mystic Energy, or Determination. However, nothing stops them from trying to rest again.

## Fatigue

Battling beasts and long journeys are tiring—anyone who's climbed the Howling Peaks knows this. Wanderers simply must rest, or they'll be too exhausted to face the next ice troll.

In YARD, one full rest per day is required. Otherwise, each additional day without rest means Wanderers start with an extra Penalty Die for all Constitution-based rolls (these dice stack).

The toughest, most stubborn Wanderers can ignore Penalty Dice by spending an equal number of Determination points.

**Example:**

- 1 day without rest – 1 Penalty Die / 1 **[DET]**
- 2 days – 2 Penalty Dice / 2 **[DET]**
- 3 days – 3 Penalty Dice / 3 **[DET]**
