# Skills

The abilities of Yardish Wanderers are chosen to reflect the actual skills of the characters. As mentioned at the start of the handbook, skill checks are resolved with a **d20** roll. To succeed, you must roll a value equal to or lower than your current skill level. If the roll is higher than your skill points, the test fails. There are also three special results:

- hard success: half your skill value or less, but more than 1
- critical success: a roll of 1
- critical failure: a roll of 20

A higher level of success usually means extra benefits for Wanderers. On a critical failure, expect unpleasant consequences.

During their travels, Wanderers will meet many beings whose attributes and skills exceed 20 points. In such cases, failure is unlikely, but a roll of 20 is always a critical failure, no matter the skill value.

### Combined Tests

In special situations, Fate may ask a player to make a combined test. Simply put, these are two consecutive skill checks, and only passing both guarantees the planned action succeeds.

### Assistance in Tests

Wanderers can assist the one making a skill check by giving them a Bonus Die. However, helpers must have the tested skill at a similar level (no more than 2 points lower than the main roller). Additionally, each helper spends one point of determination for every level of test difficulty: 1 point for normal, 2 for hard, 3 for critical. Assistance is only possible outside of combat.

**Example:** One Wanderer tries to light a campfire. Others help by gathering wood or shielding the fire from gusts of wind.

### Opposed Tests

This special type of test is simply a comparison of two characters' skills. It's like arm wrestling, though you can test different skills depending on the situation. In opposed rolls, compare the level of success: critical beats hard, hard beats normal. The same applies to normal and critical failures. If the level of success is identical, the lower roll wins.

**Example:**
A Wanderer tries to hide in the bushes using Catlike Agility to avoid a fight. The opponent is an experienced hunter, tracking the prey with the Tracking skill. The Wanderer rolls a hard success on Catlike Agility, while the hunter gets only a normal success on Tracking. The Wanderer successfully hides from danger.

## Pushing Your Luck

If a skill test fails, a Wanderer can push their luck by spending determination points. Depending on the test's difficulty, spend 1, 2, or 3 **[DET]** to try again—for normal, hard, and critical tests, respectively. Note: you can't push rolls during combat.

If you fail again, you lose one extra point of determination, regardless of the test's difficulty, and Fate will inform you of the negative consequences. This could be damaging a valuable artifact or angering an NPC.

## Skill List
Skills are divided into three groups by usefulness. The first covers various combat styles. The next is for interpersonal skills, and the last is a set of general skills useful during travels in Aleor.

During play, heroes should focus on describing what they want to do and how. The choice of skill test should always be decided by Fate—it may happen that a character tries trickery in conversation, even if they're not a typical rogue. Fate may then call for a Negotiation test, possibly increasing the difficulty. Other times, if a Wanderer is highly specialized, Fate may skip the test entirely.

Some skills have extra notes about their use in combat and the consequences of failure. These are just EXAMPLES, showing possible creative uses. Players decide what they want to do, and Fate sets the conditions. The same applies outside combat—if your character specializes in fire magic, you don't need to light a campfire by hand—a simple spell will do.

## Combat

Different fighting styles require different skills. Shooting a bow or sneaky dagger strikes need a keen eye and agility. Sword or warhammer fighting relies on raw strength, while mages and shamans use their knowledge. When creating your Wanderer, consider their traits and choose skills accordingly. After all, nothing's worse than a warrior too weak to lift his own sword.

### Arcana
**Base Attribute:** Intelligence **[INT]**

Knowing spells and rituals alone won't make you a mage. You can study every scroll in the world, but still lack the mental strength to wield magic. Arcana is the skill of controlling spoken words and the power they unleash.

### Precise Strike
**Base Attribute:** Agility **[AGI]**

This is the art of ending a fight before it begins. A well-aimed shot or a stab to the ribs can take even the boldest foe out of the duel. Most people see these methods as the domain of rogues, but Yardish hunters have a different opinion. This skill is what makes them the best hunters in the land.

### Melee Combat
**Base Attribute:** Strength **[STR]**

As local masters say... *"From the hammer—WHAM, goblin's done!"* There's a lot of truth in that. Melee combat is valued across the continent, and a good warrior can always expect a hefty reward. Sometimes it even helps in tough negotiations.

## Influence

Words are often more effective than steel, so every Wanderer should be as skilled with their tongue as with their sword. Here are the three most important skills for communicating with others.

### Roguery
**Base Attribute:** Agility **[AGI]**

Covers not just theft and forgery, but also bluffing. Not everyone approves, but it can help you avoid trouble... at least until someone catches you red-handed.

### Negotiation
**Base Attribute:** Charisma **[CHA]**

The art of diplomacy has saved many adventurers from serious consequences. Negotiators are also born merchants, able to haggle for the best goods at rock-bottom prices. Unlike Bluff, this skill is about telling the truth and doesn't risk angering your conversation partner.

### Animal Empathy
**Base Attribute:** Charisma **[CHA]**

The last, especially important for Yardans, is animal empathy. It's a mix of empathy, clear signals, and behaviors that build bonds with creatures like wolves or falcons.

**In combat:** A Wanderer with an animal companion and a high level in this skill (over 70%) can take an extra action per round, using the moves available to their animal.

## General

The broadest group, covering the Wanderer's practical skills used during travels in Aleor. Some have extra options available in combat. Using them can often tip the scales in the party's favor.

### Athletics
**Base Attribute:** Strength **[STR]**

Practical use of a Wanderer's strength. Lets you drag, lift, and throw heavy objects far. Well-developed (over 14 points) gives a Bonus Die **[BD]** when using Fury.

**In combat:** A true athlete can push boulders, logs, and all kinds of improvised thrown weapons. They can also use them well—just spend 1 **[DET]** and pass a test. Damage depends on the item and is usually set by the GM.

*Failure means losing an extra point of determination and taking normal damage.*

### Keep Moving
**Base Attribute:** Constitution **[CON]**

Years of training under master teachers let heroes keep going without looking back. Whether climbing, leaping chasms, swimming lakes, or riding nonstop, a skill over 70% lets you ignore **1 point** of elemental damage while traveling (not in combat).

### Something from Nothing
**Base Attribute:** Wisdom **[WIS]**

The skill of making traps, improvised tools, and gear is invaluable, especially in the wild. Though it often requires gathering materials, the best practitioners can whip up something useful for the party on the spot.

## Fury
**Base Attribute:** Strength **[STR]**

Where ordinary strength fails, fury appears. A Wanderer in a rage can smash any obstacle in their way. For a short time, they can also run twice as fast and far to catch their foe.

**In combat:** After taking damage, a Wanderer can enter a fury to attack with double power. Spend 1 **[DET]** and declare fury before attacking. Damage is doubled and applies only to physical attacks.

*Failure, in or out of combat, may cause you to attack the nearest character (odd roll result).* 

### Catlike Agility
**Base Attribute:** Agility **[AGI]**

Getting into hard-to-reach places, sneaking, and dodging blows all require skill. Catlike Agility can sometimes substitute for classic Roguery, especially when a baron's purse needs a new owner. In trouble, it can also help you escape.

**In combat:** When attacked, you can declare a dodge. With this skill over 70%, you can automatically dodge by spending **[DET]** equal to the attacker's success level. Passing a Catlike Agility test before combat works like a sneak attack and gives you a Bonus Die **[BD]** to attack.

*Failure means losing an extra point of determination.*

### Defender
**Base Attribute:** Constitution **[CON]**

The primal instinct to protect the pack from danger. Falling rocks, stray arrows, burning homes—a defender will try to save their companions, even at the cost of their own life.

**In combat:** At any time, a defender can shield an ally with their own body. Spend 1 determination [DET]. If successful, you take all physical damage, using your armor to reduce it.

*Failure in a defense test during combat means losing an extra point of determination. The ally you tried to protect takes normal damage.*

## Magic Resistance
**Base Attribute:** Intelligence **[INT]**

A strong mind can not only wield ancient magic but also resist it. If legends are true, shaman Kwentu passed all Lady Urune's trials thanks to this skill, earning a supernaturally long life.

**In combat:** By spending **[DET]** equal to the difficulty level, a Wanderer can completely negate a magical attack on themselves or an ally.

*Failed magic resistance means losing an extra point of determination, no matter the spell's level.*

### Shamanic Circle
**Base Attribute:** Wisdom **[WIS]**

Unlike mages, shamans don't need to learn spells from books or scrolls. Their power comes from the deity they worship. They can also make healing brews and poisons using only plants they find.

**In combat:** The shaman spends 2 **[DET]**, then draws a magic circle on the ground, where ancient energy gathers through prayer. If successful, the deity blesses the shaman, doubling the result of damage/healing.

*Failure brings the deity's wrath. You take damage equal to the base roll and lose an extra point of determination.*

### Survival
**Base Attribute:** Constitution **[CON]**

Survival skills are especially useful on long journeys. They let you set up camp without a tent and light a fire in tough conditions. Unlike Keep Moving, there's no required skill level to reduce damage (1 point) from extreme temperatures. A successful test also lets you recover 3 extra health points outside combat.

### Tracker
**Base Attribute:** Intelligence **[INT]**

A true hunter stays alert in every situation. Easily spots hidden enemies, hears faint sounds behind trees, and recognizes tracks others might miss. This skill also helps detect traps, which can save lives.

### Wandering Bard
**Base Attribute:** Charisma **[CHA]**

Who doesn't love tavern songs and heroic tales spun by silver-tongued bards? Playing an instrument or singing can be a great way to earn money, especially in a strange city. The right tune can also lift spirits, restoring 2 extra determination points.

**In combat:** A basic bard song can inspire allies, giving them a Bonus Die. It can also disrupt enemy concentration (Penalty Die). A true virtuoso can do much more—just declare a specific song and spend 1 **[DET]** to help allies or weaken foes.

*Failure in combat means losing an extra point of determination, and the song has the opposite effect.*

### Secret Knowledge
**Base Attribute:** Wisdom **[WIS]**

This skill is mainly for learning magic from scrolls, understanding old tomes, and knowing runes. With the right ingredients, you can also make potions and special glyphs that work as magical traps. Sometimes it lets you understand foreign, especially ancient, languages. To learn a new spell, a mage must pass a test, as must an inventor wanting to build fancy traps.
