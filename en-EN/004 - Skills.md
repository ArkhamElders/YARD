# Skills

The abilities of Yardan Wanderers have been selected to reflect the actual skills of the characters. As mentioned at the beginning of the manual, skill tests are resolved using a **d20** roll. To succeed, you must roll a value equal to or lower than your current skill level. If the result is higher than your skill points, the test fails. There are also three special results:

- hard success: half the skill value or less, but more than 1
- critical success: a roll of 1
- critical failure: a roll of 20

A higher level of success usually means benefits for Wanderers. In the case of a critical failure, they must expect unpleasant consequences.

During their journeys, Wanderers will encounter many beings whose attributes and skills exceed 20 points. In such cases, failure is unlikely. However, regardless of this value, a critical failure still occurs on a roll of 20.

### Combined Tests

In special situations, Fate may ask a player to perform a combined test. Simply put, these are two consecutive skill tests, and only passing both guarantees the planned action succeeds.

### Support in Tests

Wanderers can support the tester in their skill test by giving them the same bonus die. However, they must have the tested skill at an appropriate level, close (no more than 2 points lower) to the tester's level. Additionally, supporters spend one determination point for each difficulty level: 1 pt - normal, 2 pts - hard, 3 pts - critical. Support in skill tests is only possible outside of combat.

**Example:** One Wanderer tries to light a campfire. Others help by gathering wood or shielding the fire from strong wind.

### Opposed Tests

This specific type of test is simply a comparison of the skills of two characters. It resembles an arm-wrestling match, though depending on the situation, different skills may be tested. In opposed rolls, levels of success are compared: critical beats hard, hard beats normal. The same applies to normal and critical failures. If the level of success is identical, the lower roll wins.

**Example:**
A Wanderer tries to hide from an opponent in the bushes, using Catlike Agility to avoid combat. The opponent is an experienced hunter, trying to track the victim with Tracking. The Wanderer rolls a hard success on Catlike Agility, while the hunter only gets a normal success on Tracking. The Wanderer manages to hide from danger.

## Pushing the Roll

If a skill test fails, a Wanderer can push the roll by spending determination points. Depending on the test's difficulty, they spend 1, 2, or 3 **[DET]** points to try again for normal, hard, and extreme (critical) tests, respectively. Importantly, rolls cannot be pushed during combat.

If unsuccessful, the Wanderer loses one additional determination point, regardless of the test's difficulty, and Fate informs them of the negative consequences of pushing the roll. This could be, for example, damaging a valuable artifact or angering a person encountered.

## Skill List
Skills are divided by usefulness into three separate groups. The first concerns various combat methods. The next covers interpersonal skills, and the last is a collection of general skills useful during journeys across Aleor.

During gameplay, heroes should focus primarily on describing what and how they want to do. The choice of a possible skill test should always be decided by Fate—it may happen that a character wants to use trickery in conversation, even though they are not a typical rogue. Fate may then ask for a Negotiation test, possibly increasing the test's difficulty. At other times, considering the Wanderer's high specialization in a field, Fate may skip the test entirely.

Most skills are also used in combat as tricks. Players decide what they want to do, and Fate sets the conditions. The same applies outside combat—if your character specializes in fire magic, they don't need to light a campfire manually—a simple spell will do the job.

## Combat

Different fighting styles require different skills. For example, shooting a bow or sneaky dagger strikes require a keen eye and agility. Fighting with a sword or warhammer relies mainly on strength, while mages and shamans use their acquired knowledge. When creating your Wanderer, consider their traits and choose appropriate skills. After all, nothing is worse than a warrior who lacks the strength to lift their own sword.

### Arcana

**Base Attribute:** Intelligence **[INT]**

Knowing spells and rituals alone does not make one a mage. You can study all the scrolls in the world, but still have a mind too weak to use magic effectively. Arcana is the skill of controlling spoken words and the power that flows from them.

### Precise Strike

**Base Attribute:** Agility **[AGI]**

This is the skill of ending a fight before it truly begins. A well-aimed shot or a blow to the ribs can take even the bravest out of the duel. While most people see such methods as the domain of rogues, Yardan hunters have a different opinion. This skill makes them the best hunters in all the lands.

### Powerful Blow

**Base Attribute:** Strength **[STR]**

As local masters say... "From the hammer, WHAM, goblin dead!" There is much truth in this. Melee combat is valued across the continent, and a good warrior can always expect a generous reward. Sometimes it also helps in particularly tough negotiations.

## Influence

Words are often more effective than steel, so every Wanderer should be as skilled with language as with a sword. Below are the three most important skills used when communicating with encountered beings.

### Threat

**Base Attribute:** Strength **[STR]**

As they say... if the strength of arguments fails, there's always the argument of strength. Intimidating encountered characters is usually not the best way to conduct dialogue, but it can be effective, especially with stubborn interlocutors.

### Negotiation

**Base Attribute:** Charisma **[CHA]**

The art of diplomacy has saved many adventurers from serious consequences. Negotiators are also born merchants, able to bargain for the best goods for a few coins. Oh... and one more thing—negotiations don't have to be fair, though unlike threats, they don't resort to force.

### Animal Understanding

**Base Attribute:** Charisma **[CHA]**

The last skill, especially important for Yardans, is animal understanding. It combines empathy, clear communication, and behaviors that build bonds, e.g., with a wolf or falcon.

**In combat:** A Wanderer with an animal companion and a high level of this skill (over 14 pts) can perform an additional action in a round, as part of the moves available to the animal.

## General

The broadest group, defining the actual skills of a Wanderer, used during journeys across Aleor. Some have additional options, also available in combat. Their use can often tip the scales of victory in the party's favor.

### Athletics

**Base Attribute:** Strength **[STR]**

Practical use of a Wanderer's strength. Allows dragging, lifting, and throwing heavy objects over long distances. Well-developed (over 14 pts) grants a bonus die **[BD]** when using Fury.

**In combat:** A true athlete can push rocks, logs, and any improvised thrown weapon. Moreover, they can use it well—just spend 1 **[DET]** point and pass the test. Damage depends on the item used and is usually determined by the GM.

*Failure results in losing an additional determination point and taking normal damage.*

### Keep Moving

**Base Attribute:** Endurance **[END]**

Years of training under great masters allow Heroes to keep moving forward without looking back. Whether climbing, jumping over chasms, swimming across lakes, or riding without stopping. Well-developed (over 14 pts) also allows ignoring **1 pt** of elemental damage during travel (not in combat).

### Something from Nothing

**Base Attribute:** Wisdom **[WIS]**

The skill of constructing traps, makeshift tools, and other equipment is invaluable, especially in the wild. Although it often requires gathering necessary materials, the best adepts of this somewhat underrated art can quickly make something that helps the party more than expected.

### Catlike Agility

**Base Attribute:** Agility **[AGI]**

Getting into hard-to-reach places, sneaking, and dodging blows requires skill. Catlike Agility can sometimes substitute for classic roguery, especially when a baron's purse needs a new owner. In trouble, it can also be used to escape.

### Roguery

**Base Attribute:** Agility **[AGI]**

Not a noble path, but well-paid. The powerful often use the services of rogues, thieves, and assassins to gain influence. A good rogue not only steals purses but also prepares the right poison. Traps? They hold no secrets for them.

### Defense

**Base Attribute:** Endurance **[END]**

The primal instinct to protect the herd from danger. Falling rocks, stray arrows, or burning homes—a defender will try to save their kin, even at the cost of their own life. Of course, a Wanderer can also use this to block attacks aimed at themselves.

## Magic Resistance

**Base Attribute:** Intelligence **[INT]**

A strong mind can not only master ancient magic but also resist it. If legends are true, it was thanks to this skill that the shaman Kwentu passed all the trials of Lady Urune, who rewarded her with supernaturally long life.

### Shamanic Circle

**Base Attribute:** Wisdom **[WIS]**

Unlike mages, shamans do not need to learn spells. Their power comes from the deity they worship. They can also prepare healing brews and poisons using only plants at hand. Used for casting stronger healing spells in combat.

### Survival

**Base Attribute:** Endurance **[END]**

The skill of surviving in the wild is especially useful during long journeys. Allows easy camp setup without a tent and lighting a fire in less favorable conditions. Well-developed (over 14 pts) allows ignoring 1 pt of damage from fire, cold, or poison. A successful test also allows regenerating 3 extra health points outside combat.

### Tracker

**Base Attribute:** Intelligence **[INT]**

A true hunter stays alert in every situation. Easily spots hidden enemies, hears faint sounds from behind a tree, and recognizes tracks others might miss. This skill also allows detecting traps, which can sometimes save lives.

### Wandering Bard

**Base Attribute:** Charisma **[CHA]**

Who doesn't love tavern songs and heroic tales told by silver-tongued bards? Playing an instrument or singing can be a great way to earn money, especially in a foreign city. The right melody can also boost morale, regenerating 2 extra determination points.

### Arcane Knowledge

**Base Attribute:** Wisdom **[WIS]**

This skill is mainly used for learning magic from scrolls, understanding old books, and knowing runes. It also allows, with the right ingredients, to prepare elixirs and special glyphs that work as magical traps. Sometimes it also helps understand foreign, especially ancient languages. To learn a new spell, a mage must pass a test, as must an inventor wanting to build elaborate traps.

## More Skills

The manual contains only the most important skills, allowing for free gameplay and simple mechanics. If you feel the need to add new, more specialized abilities, nothing stands in your way. It's your game, and you can run it as you wish. Just remember that too many skills can cause unnecessary confusion, and simplicity encourages Wanderers' creativity.
