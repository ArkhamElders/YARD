# Creating Wanderers

Creating your own character is, for many players, one of the most important elements of gameplay. It’s no wonder, as this is where much of the beauty of RPGs lies. Let’s get to the heart of it.

Wanderers are described by six main traits, known as Attributes. Each directly affects skills, movement range, and the development of Vitality Points and Mystic Energy during advancement. Well-developed attributes (starting from 15 points) also allow you to gain Sparks, which you can read about in the chapter on character development.

Determining attribute values is very simple and can be done in two ways.

### Double Roll Method

Each attribute is determined by two rolls of **3d6**, choosing the higher result. Of course, Fate may allow you to reroll particularly low results (below 5) to maintain proper balance within the party.

**Example:**
A player rolls for Strength, making two sets of rolls with three d6 dice:

- First set: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
- Second set: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

The higher result is 14, which becomes the base value for Strength. With this method, manual adjustment of attribute values is not allowed—the roll result is binding.

### Point Pool Method

Sometimes players want to manually adjust the values of individual attributes. In this case, you can use a different method: roll **3d6** six times. The sum creates a pool of points to distribute among the attributes. It’s important that each attribute’s minimum value is between 3 and 18. This is due to further attribute modifications based on age and origin.

**Example:**
STR - 14, END - 15, AGI - 7, INT - 10, WIS - 12, CHA - 6
Total 64 points. The player decides to subtract 2 points from Wisdom and add 1 each to Strength and Endurance. The total remains 64 points, so this adjustment is allowed.

## Attributes

### Strength [STR]

Represents the Wanderer’s physical prowess, ability to lift objects and weapons. It translates to dealing high damage in melee combat and resisting attacks. It is the primary trait of all warriors.

### Endurance [END]

Responsible for your character’s stamina and resilience. It determines how long they can run or how resistant they are to damage. It’s also useful for tireless adventurers and those who choose a life in the wild.

### Agility [AGI]

The key attribute of master thieves and true hunters. Agility is needed wherever quick, precise strikes are required. In trouble, it also helps you escape safely.

### Intelligence [INT]

Mental strength and deductive ability are invaluable, both in negotiations and combat. A clever Wanderer will easily find a way out of even the toughest situation. It’s also the main trait of those who practice magic.

### Wisdom [WIS]

Wisdom gained from studying books, divine blessings, and experience allows you to handle what is incomprehensible to others. It lets you create elixirs, repair weapons, and study the teachings of ancient masters.

### Charisma [CHA]

A bit of personal charm can be extremely useful. It allows you to influence people, beasts, and animals you encounter. Thanks to charisma, you’ll gain new allies and buy better equipment at a bargain price.

## Character Age

The inhabitants of Aleor age at different rates. It all depends on the Wanderer’s origin. Humans age the fastest, while Yardans, thanks to Urune’s blessing, live almost twice as long. The continent is also home to other, extremely long-lived peoples, so a hero’s age is determined by one of three stages: youth, adulthood, and old age. Each has a different impact on character attributes. Below you’ll find attribute and basic skill modifications by age—read them carefully.

### Youth

+1 to [END] and [AGI], -2 to [WIS]
One additional basic skill based on agility or charisma.

### Adulthood

+1 to [WIS] and [STR]
Standard number of basic skills.

### Old Age

+2 to [WIS], -1 to [END] and [STR]
One additional skill based on knowledge.

Modify your stats on the character sheet according to your Wanderer’s chosen age. Remember, age cannot be changed during gameplay. Consider which age best suits your character. While nothing prevents you from playing a young mage, the most powerful ones gained their knowledge over many years. Likewise, it’s hard to imagine an old, experienced thief competing with a young one in terms of speed.

## Origin

Although the game is primarily focused on Yardans, you can choose any origin you like. Below you’ll find descriptions of the six most populous peoples of Aleor. While the differences between races aren’t huge, each has its own unique benefits, usually unavailable to others. It’s worth considering to create an interesting character.

### Yardans

Wolf rulers inhabiting northern Aleor. For generations, they have lived in the shadow of the Howling Peaks and surrounding forests, allowing them to move silently and excel in the wild. These born hunters often strike from hiding, delivering a deadly blow before the enemy realizes.

Stronger and more resilient than elves, to whom they are closely related. Like their cousins, they have long, pointed ears. However, they are better built and battle-hardened, and due to the harsh northern climate, Yardan men’s faces are usually covered with long, thick beards. Thanks to close contact with the Tascals, they are familiar with heavier weapons and armor, though they usually prefer more discreet arms.

Unlike elves, they hunt eagerly, mainly using wolves with whom they share a special bond. It is said that when a Yardan dies, his wolf goes to Urune with him. They are the only ones who completely reject magical teachings. Their Mystic Energy is based solely on the grace of the Primal Mother. A Yardan wishing to wield magic can only choose the path of the shaman.

Another thing that distinguishes Yardans from other inhabitants of Aleor is their relationship with canines. More information on this can be found in the Animal Companion chapter.

**Modifications:** +1 to [CHA] and [AGI]. [INT] reduced by 2.

### Humans

One of the most numerous and youngest peoples inhabiting Aleor. Their cities and smaller settlements are mainly concentrated in the central part of the continent. Although they have no innate predispositions, they do well in most professions.

Interestingly, humans were the first to develop mysterious knowledge that gradually replaced shamanism. The new power differed significantly from previously known spells. Above all, magical incantations no longer required the grace of capricious deities. In their pride, some human mages even proclaimed themselves new gods. It’s not hard to guess their fate...

The number of skill points, like the number of attribute points, is a fixed value. **Each Wanderer has 18 points** to spend on any skills, adding them to base values. The fixed pool ensures all players have equal chances at the start, encouraging thoughtful character creation. Remember, a skill’s value cannot exceed the attribute it’s based on, and its natural upper limit is 20 points (yes, there are ways to increase these supernaturally—spells, potions, artifacts).
