# Creating Wanderers

Creating your own character is, for many players, one of the most important aspects of the game. It’s no wonder—this is where much of the magic of RPGs lies. So let’s get to the heart of it.

Wanderers are defined by six main traits, known as Attributes. Each one directly affects skills, movement range, and the development of Vitality Points and Mystic Energy as your character advances.

Determining attribute values is very simple and can be done in two ways.

### Double Roll Method

Each attribute is set by rolling **3d6** twice and choosing the higher result. Of course, Fate may allow you to reroll particularly low results (below 5) to maintain proper balance within the party.

**Example:**
A player rolls for Strength, making two sets of rolls with three d6 dice:

- First set: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
- Second set: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

The higher result is 14, so that becomes the base value for Strength. Using this method, manual adjustment of attribute values is not allowed—the roll result is binding.

### Point Pool Method

Sometimes players wish to manually adjust the values of individual attributes. In such cases, an alternative method can be used: roll six sets of **3d6**. The total sum creates a pool of points to be distributed among the attributes. It is important that the minimum value of each attribute remains within the range of 3-18. This is due to further attribute modifications based on the character’s age and origin.

**Example:**
STR - 14, END - 15, AGI - 7, INT - 10, WIS - 12, CHA - 6
Total: 64 points. The player decides to subtract 2 points from Wisdom and add 1 each to Strength and Endurance. The sum remains 64, so this adjustment is allowed.

## Attributes

### Strength [STR]

Represents the Wanderer’s physical prowess, ability to lift objects and wield weapons. It translates to dealing higher damage in melee combat and resisting attacks. It’s the primary trait of all warriors.

### Endurance [END]

Determines your character’s stamina and resilience. It shows how long they can run or how resistant they are to damage. It’s invaluable for tireless adventurers and those who choose a life in the wild.

### Agility [AGI]
The key attribute for master thieves and true hunters. Agility is needed wherever quick, precise strikes are required. In trouble, it also helps you escape to safety swiftly.

### Intelligence [INT]
Mental strength and deductive ability are invaluable, both in negotiations and combat. A clever Wanderer will easily find a way out of even the toughest situation. It’s also the main trait for those who practice magic.

### Wisdom [WIS]
Wisdom gained from studying tomes, divine blessings, and experience allows you to handle what others find incomprehensible. It lets you craft elixirs, repair weapons, and delve into the teachings of ancient masters.

### Charisma [CHA]
A touch of personal charm can be extremely useful. It allows you to influence people, encountered beasts, and animals. Thanks to charisma, you’ll gain new allies and buy better gear for a bargain price.

## Character Age

The people of Aleor age at different rates, depending on their origin. Humans grow old the fastest, while Yardans, blessed by Urune, live almost twice as long. The continent is also home to other, remarkably long-lived folk, so a hero’s age is determined by one of three stages: youth, adulthood, and old age. Each has a different impact on the character’s attributes. Below you’ll find attribute and skill modifications by age—read them carefully.

### Youth

+1 to [END] and [AGI], -2 to [WIS]
One additional basic skill based on agility or charisma.

### Adulthood

+1 to [WIS] and [STR]
Standard number of basic skills.

### Old Age

+2 to [WIS], -1 to [END] and [STR]
One additional basic skill based on knowledge.

Modify your stats on the character sheet according to your Wanderer’s chosen age. Remember, age cannot be changed during the game. Consider which age best suits your character. While nothing stops you from playing a young mage, the most powerful ones gained their knowledge over many years. Likewise, it’s hard to imagine an old, though experienced, thief competing with the young in terms of speed.

## Origin

While the game is primarily focused on Yardans, you may choose any origin you wish. Below are descriptions of the six most populous peoples of Aleor. Though the differences between races aren’t huge, each has its own unique benefits, usually unavailable to others. Keep this in mind to create the most interesting character possible.

### Yardans

Wolf lords dwelling in northern Aleor. For generations, they’ve lived in the shadow of the Howling Peaks and nearby forests, moving silently and thriving in the wild. These born hunters often strike from hiding, delivering a deadly blow before their foe can react.

Stronger and more resilient than elves, their close kin. Like their cousins, they have long, pointed ears, but Yardans are sturdier and battle-hardened. The harsh northern climate means Yardan men often sport long, thick beards. Thanks to close ties with the Tascalians, they’re no strangers to heavier weapons and armor, though they usually prefer subtler arms.

Unlike elves, Yardans hunt eagerly, mainly with wolves, with whom they share a special bond. It’s said that when a Yardan dies, his wolf goes to Urune with him. They alone reject magical teachings entirely. Their Mystic Energy comes solely from the grace of the Primal Mother. A Yardan wishing to wield magic may only walk the path of the shaman.

Another thing that sets Yardans apart from other Aleor dwellers is their relationship with canines. More on this can be found in the Animal Companion chapter.

**Modifications:** +1 to [CHA] and [AGI]. [INT] reduced by 2.

### Humans

One of the most numerous and youngest peoples of Aleor. Their cities and smaller settlements are mainly in the continent’s center. Though they lack innate predispositions, they do well in most professions.

Interestingly, humans were the first to develop mysterious knowledge that gradually replaced shamanism. This new power differed greatly from known spells. Above all, magical incantations no longer required the favor of capricious deities. In their pride, some human mages even proclaimed themselves new gods. It’s not hard to guess their fate...

Human magic brought much good to Aleor. Eagerly adopted and developed by other peoples, it led to technological progress and improved quality of life for many. Notably, humans are somehow more resistant to the effects of crystals, so when using magic, they lose only half as many Vitality Points.

**Modifications:** Humans may add 1 point to any attribute, but must subtract the same amount from another chosen trait.

### Dwarves

Tascalians, lovers of smithing, battle, good wine, and beer. Especially for the latter, they have excellent relations with the people of Yard.

During many shared feasts, they like to joke about their neighbors’ origins. According to them, Yardans are the offspring of Tascalians and elves from the Wandering Forest. The Tascalians’ strength is their hammer or axe. Most scorn other weapons. They possess vast knowledge, though they rarely share it.

A true dwarf knows no fear and never backs down from even the greatest danger. Well... unless it’s about horses... If you ever see a Tascali riding a horse, know that he’s either lost his mind or is drunk. Their dislike of popular mounts is likely due to the smiths’ short stature, so they travel long distances on yaks.

These sturdy smiths are also famous for their strong heads, able to drink extra alcohol and thus regenerate more determination points.

Proud and wise, dwarves are considered one of Aleor’s oldest races—at least, that’s what they claim.

**Modifications:** +1 to [WIS] and [STR]. [CHA] reduced by 2.

### Elves

A long-lived people, originally from the Wandering Forest, now found in nearly every major city. Aleor owes the defeat of Madhrat and the end of one of the worst mage wars to the elves. The ruins of his fortress still lie hidden deep in the woods, sealed by powerful elven spells.

Elves, though not as strong as others, possess vast knowledge passed down through generations. Thanks to this, they alone can wield both shamanic spells and magic.

Their exceptional respect for all life means they rarely hunt and only fight when cornered. Interestingly, Forest dwellers don’t build typical cities—the entire forest is their home. Entering the woods, a wanderer can be sure they’re being watched. Elves live among the trees and shrubs, protecting their homes from outsiders’ eyes.

**Modifications:** +1 to [WIS] and [INT]. [STR] reduced by 2.

### Halflings

Masters of juggling, thievery, and surprise attacks. If you’ve just been hit by a stone and don’t know where it came from, you can bet one of these little tricksters is nearby. Still, halflings are usually peaceful, valuing comfort, good humor, and even better food. Contrary to popular belief, they don’t live underground—their homes are simply lower than those built by other peoples.

Their homeland is Cest, but over the ages, they’ve wandered far west. Seeing a halfling in Ofren is nothing unusual, especially in Aleborn, famous for its cuisine and entertainment.

These small folk aren’t known for exceptional wisdom. It’s likely due to their love of comfort—a content halfling rarely feels the need to learn new things, especially if it means laboriously studying tomes.

Because of their stature, they have a natural talent for avoiding danger, so every attempt to hide or dodge is made with a Bonus Die.

**Modifications:** +1 to [AGI] and [INT]. [WIS] reduced by 2.

### Beastfolk

The youngest people of Aleor, with a fascinating history. Beastfolk, also called hybrids, are incredibly diverse.

They arose from vile experiments. Power-hungry early mages created various hybrids, combining animals, beasts, and sometimes even demons with the continent’s inhabitants. After the mage wars ended, surviving Beastfolk settled in today’s Bayden, forming their own community. If you travel to the Quashan Bay area, you’ll surely meet many of them.

Their supernatural origin means Beastfolk can adapt to almost any conditions. Their innate magical bond allows them, from the start, to wield two schools of magic within their chosen type—for example, a beastfolk shaman may choose both fire and water at the beginning of the game. Additionally, **all magical damage is reduced by 1** due to a certain degree of resistance.

Though their cruel times are behind them, they sometimes still face unequal treatment. Perhaps that’s why they’re reluctant to leave Bayden.

**Modifications:** Beastfolk may distribute 2 additional points among any attributes, subtracting 1 from another chosen trait.

## Vitality

Represents your character’s hit points—the amount of damage they can withstand before their adventure ends. Calculating Vitality Points is simply adding Strength and Endurance, then dividing by two and rounding down.

**Example:** A character has 14 Strength and 15 Endurance, totaling 29 points. Dividing by 2 gives 14.5, which rounds down to 14 Vitality Points.

## Mystic Energy

A good shaman or mage should not only know spells but also have a sharp mind and the right skills to use them. Therefore, Mystic Energy Points are the sum of Wisdom and Intelligence divided by 2.

**Example:** The character’s Wisdom and Intelligence are 16 and 12, respectively, totaling 28. Dividing by 2 gives 14 Mystic Energy Points. In this case, there’s no need to round the result.

## Movement

As you might guess, this determines the maximum distance a Wanderer can move during their turn. Movement is used in combat or chases. Standard travel doesn’t require calculating every meter. Movement is calculated similarly to Vitality and Mystic Energy, but the base values are Endurance and Agility.

## Determination

Represents the character’s willpower, ambition, and persistence. It allows you to force failed rolls and take extra actions in combat. More details on using determination can be found in the skills section. To calculate your starting Determination [DET], roll **3d6**. If you roll 4, 4, and 5, you start your adventure with 13 points. Determination is the driving force of the Wanderer and is extremely important. If it drops to zero, the character makes every skill test with a Misfortune Die [MD]. This state lasts until at least one point of determination is regained.

There are several ways to restore points. The first is rest. Regeneration is also possible after completing an important story quest, such as defeating an ice troll or finding a missing merchant. In this case, the amount of points restored is up to Fate. Other ways include various spells, elixirs, and songs of wandering bards. Some not only restore points but also temporarily increase their maximum amount.

Since YARD is focused on Wanderer development, it’s possible to increase the maximum value of determination. For every five levels, characters gain two additional points—the first at level five, the next at ten, and so on. Record all attribute, vitality, mystic energy, movement, and determination values on your Wanderer Sheet. You’ll find the sheet at the end of this handbook.

## Armor, Attack, and Attack Modifier

### Armor

Armor is simply the amount of physical damage a Wanderer can ignore when attacked. Its value is determined by adding the defense points of each piece of armor, shield, or helmet. If a Wanderer has armor granting 2 defense points and a shield granting 1, they have 3 armor points, reducing incoming damage by that amount.

Importantly, standard armor only protects against physical damage. Only exceptional items can negate magical attacks.

### Attack

Every unarmed character, regardless of age or origin, has a basic physical attack of 1 point, representing fighting with fists. If a Wanderer equips a dagger or other weapon, their attack is determined by the item’s properties. For example, a dagger deals 1 damage, a short sword 2. A Wanderer with more than 70 points of Catlike Agility can also fight with two weapons.

### Damage Modifier

The stronger the Wanderer, the more physical damage they deal, regardless of weapon.

**Strength 1-2:** -3 to attack (Extremely weak, very difficult to land blows).

---

**Strength 3-5:** -2 to attack (Weakling, struggles to hit effectively).

**Strength 6-8:** -1 to attack (Below average, slight edge over the weakest).

**Strength 9-12:** +0 to attack (Average strength, typical for most unspecialized characters).

**Strength 13-15:** +1 to attack (Strong, visible muscles, better in melee).

**Strength 16-18:** +2 to attack (Very strong, impressive power, true warrior).

**Strength 19-20:** +3 to attack (Superhuman strength, commands respect).

---

**Strength 21-23:** +4 to attack (Heroic strength, mighty blows).

**Strength 23+:** +5 to attack (Mythic/legendary strength, destructive power).

Add the modifier to the attack value to get the final damage dealt. If fighting with two weapons, the attack modifier applies only to the main hand. The off hand uses the basic attack.

**Example:**
A Wanderer attacks a troll with a sword dealing 2 damage and has an attack modifier of 2. The total attack value is 4, so the troll takes 4 damage if it has no armor.

Combat is discussed in more detail later in the handbook.

## Skill Points

Once you’ve determined your character’s age and origin, you can set the base values for skills and distribute points. Since YARD emphasizes freedom of play, you won’t find imposed professions or character classes here. In other words, you decide who your Wanderer is and how they develop during their journeys across Aleor.

### Base Values

Before distributing skill points, you must set their base values. By default, every Wanderer has four basic skills of their choice. Depending on your character’s age, you may have one additional skill based on a specific attribute. This rule reflects the natural predispositions and innate talents of Wanderers.

The value of a basic skill is equal to half the attribute it’s based on (rounded down). Simply put, if a basic skill is based on strength, its starting value will be half of strength.

The base value of other skills is 1.

### Point Distribution

The number of skill points, like attribute points, is fixed. **Each Wanderer has 18 points** to spend on any skills, adding them to the base values. The fixed pool ensures all players have equal chances at the start and encourages thoughtful character creation. Remember, a skill’s value cannot exceed the attribute it’s based on, and its natural upper limit is 20 points (yes, there are ways to increase these—spells, potions, artifacts).
