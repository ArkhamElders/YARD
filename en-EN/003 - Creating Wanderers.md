# Creating Wanderers

## Attributes
Creating your own character is, for many players, one of the most important parts of the game. No wonder—it's where much of the magic of RPGs lies. So let's get to the heart of it.

Wanderers are described by six main traits, known as Attributes. Each one directly affects skills, movement range, and the development of Vitality Points and Mystic Energy as you level up.

Determining attribute values is simple. For each, roll **3d6** twice and take the higher result. Of course, Fate may allow you to reroll especially low results (below 9) to keep the party balanced.

**Example:**
A player rolls for Strength, making two sets of three d6 rolls:

- First set: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
- Second set: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

The higher result is 14, so that's the base Strength value.

Sometimes players want to manually adjust their attribute values, subtracting points from one trait and adding them to another to better fit their character concept. That's fine, as long as the total points remain unchanged. Each attribute must also be between 3 and 18, to allow for further modifications based on age and origin.

**Example:**
STR - 14, CON - 15, AGI - 7, INT - 10, WIS - 12, CHA - 6
Total: 64 points. The player decides to subtract 2 from Wisdom and add 1 each to Strength and Constitution. The sum is still 64, so that's allowed.

### Strength [STR]
Represents the Wanderer's physical power, ability to lift objects and weapons. It translates to dealing high damage in melee and resisting attacks. The core trait for all warriors.

### Constitution [CON]
Determines your character's endurance and toughness. It shows how long they can run or how resistant they are to damage. Essential for tireless adventurers and those who choose a rugged life in the wild.

### Agility [AGI]
The key trait for master thieves and true hunters. Agility is needed wherever quick, precise strikes matter. In trouble, it helps you escape safely and swiftly.

### Intelligence [INT]
Mental strength and deductive ability are invaluable, both in negotiations and combat. A clever Wanderer can find a way out of even the toughest situation. It's also the main trait for those who practice magic.

### Wisdom [WIS]
Wisdom from studying tomes, divine blessings, and experience lets you handle what others can't understand. It allows you to craft potions, repair weapons, and delve into the teachings of ancient masters.

### Charisma [CHA]
A touch of personal charm is always useful. It lets you influence people, beasts, and animals you meet. Thanks to charisma, you'll gain new allies and buy better gear for a laughable price.

## Character Age

Aleor's people age at different rates, depending on their origin. Humans age fastest, while Yardans, blessed by Urune, live almost twice as long. The continent is also home to other long-lived folk, so a hero's age is set by one of three stages: youth, adulthood, and old age. Each affects your attributes differently. Below you'll find the modifications for each age—review them carefully.

### Youth
+1 to [CON] and [AGI], -2 to [WIS]
One extra basic skill based on agility or charisma.

### Adulthood
+1 to [WIS] and [STR]
Standard number of basic skills.

### Old Age
+2 to [WIS], -1 to [CON] and [STR]
One extra basic skill based on knowledge.

Adjust your character sheet stats according to your Wanderer's chosen age. Remember, age can't be changed during play. Think about which age best fits your character. While nothing stops you from playing a young mage, the most powerful ones gained their wisdom over years. Likewise, it's hard to imagine an old, experienced thief outpacing a young one.

## Origin

While the game focuses mainly on Yardans, you can choose any origin you like. Below are descriptions of Aleor's six most populous peoples. The differences aren't huge, but each has unique benefits, usually unavailable to others. Consider these to create an interesting character.

### Yardans
Wolf lords of northern Aleor. For generations they've lived in the shadow of the Howling Peaks and nearby forests, moving silently and thriving in the wild. Born hunters, they often strike from hiding, delivering a fatal blow before their foe even knows they're there.

Stronger and tougher than elves, their close kin. Like their cousins, they have long, pointed ears, but are more robust and battle-hardened. Thanks to the harsh northern climate, Yardish men usually sport long, thick beards. Their close ties with the people of Tascal mean they're no strangers to heavy weapons and armor, though they prefer subtler arms.

Unlike elves, Yardans hunt eagerly, mainly using wolves with whom they share a special bond. It's said that when a Yardan dies, his wolf goes to Urune with him. They're the only ones who completely reject magical studies. Their Mystic Energy comes solely from the First Mother's grace. If a Yardan wants to wield magic, he can only walk the shaman's path.

Another thing that sets Yardans apart is their relationship with canines. More on this in the Animal Companion chapter.

**Modifications:** +1 [CHA] and [AGI]. [INT] reduced by 2.

### Humans
One of Aleor's most numerous and youngest peoples. Their cities and towns are mostly in the continent's center. Though they lack innate talents, they're pretty good at most professions.

Interestingly, humans were the first to develop mysterious science that eventually replaced shamanism. The new power was very different from known spells—magical incantations no longer required the favor of fickle gods. In their pride, some human mages even called themselves new gods. You can guess how that ended...

Human magic brought much good to Aleor. Eagerly adopted and developed by other peoples, it led to technological progress and better lives for many. Notably, humans are somewhat resistant to crystals, so when using magic, they lose only half as many Vitality Points.

**Modifications:** Humans may add 1 point to any attribute, but must subtract the same from another of their choice.

### Dwarves
Tascal-born lovers of smithing, battle, good wine, and beer. Especially the last, which keeps them on great terms with Yardans.

During many shared feasts, they joke about their neighbors' origins. According to them, Yardans are the result of a union between Tascal dwarves and elves from the Wandering Forest. A Tascal's strength is his hammer or axe—most scorn other weapons. They have vast knowledge, but rarely share it.

A true dwarf knows no fear and never backs down from danger. Well... unless horses are involved. If you ever see a Tascal riding a horse, he's either lost his mind or is drunk. Their dislike of common mounts is likely due to their short stature, so they travel long distances on yaks.

These sturdy smiths are also famous for their strong heads, able to drink extra alcohol and thus restore more determination points.

Proud and wise, dwarves are considered one of Aleor's oldest races—at least, that's what they say.

**Modifications:** +1 [WIS] and [STR]. [CHA] reduced by 2.

### Elves
Long-lived folk, originally from the Wandering Forest, now found in most big cities. Aleor owes its victory over Madhrat and the end of the worst mage wars to the elves. The ruins of his fortress still lie deep in the woods, sealed by powerful elven spells.

Elves, though not as strong as others, possess vast knowledge passed down through generations. They're the only ones who can use both shamanic and arcane magic at once.

Their respect for all life means they rarely hunt and only fight when cornered. Interestingly, forest dwellers don't build typical cities—the whole forest is their home. Entering the woods, a wanderer can be sure he's being watched. Elves live in trees and among shrubs, protecting their homes from outsiders' eyes.

**Modifications:** +1 [WIS] and [INT]. [STR] reduced by 2.

### Halflings
Masters of trickery, thievery, and sneak attacks. If you've just been hit by a stone and don't know where it came from, you can bet one of these little rascals is nearby. Still, halflings are usually peaceful, valuing comfort, good humor, and even better food. Contrary to popular belief, they don't live underground—their homes are just a bit shorter than those of other peoples.

Their homeland is Cest, but over time they've wandered far west. Seeing a halfling in Ofren is nothing strange, especially in Aleborn, famous for its cuisine and entertainment.

These small folk aren't known for wisdom. It's likely due to their love of comfort—satisfied halflings rarely feel the need to learn new things, especially if it means slogging through books.

Thanks to their stature, they have a natural knack for avoiding danger, so every attempt to hide or dodge is made with a Bonus Die.

**Modifications:** +1 [AGI] and [INT]. [WIS] reduced by 2.

### Beastfolk
Aleor's youngest people, with a fascinating history. Beastfolk, also called hybrids, are highly diverse.

They were created by vile experiments. Power-hungry early mages made hybrids—combinations of animals, beasts, sometimes even demons with the continent's inhabitants. After the mage wars ended, surviving Beastfolk settled in Bayden, forming their own community. If you travel to the Quashan Bay area, you'll meet many of them.

Their supernatural origin means Beastfolk can adapt to almost any conditions. Their innate magical bond lets them start with two magic domains in their chosen type—for example, a beastfolk shaman can pick both fire and water at the start. Also, **all magic damage is reduced by 1** due to a degree of resistance.

Though their cruel times are behind them, they still face discrimination. Maybe that's why they rarely leave Bayden.

**Modifications:** Beastfolk may distribute 2 extra points among any attributes, subtracting 1 from another of their choice.

## Vitality

Represents your character's hit points—the amount of damage they can take before their adventure ends. To calculate Vitality Points, add Strength and Constitution, then divide by two and round down.

**Example:** A character has 14 Strength and 15 Constitution, totaling 29. Divide by 2 to get 14.5, which rounds down to 14 Vitality Points.

## Mystic Energy

A good shaman or mage should not only know spells, but also have a sharp mind and the right skills to use them. So Mystic Energy Points are the sum of Wisdom and Intelligence, divided by 2.

**Example:** Wisdom and Intelligence are 16 and 12, totaling 28. Divide by 2 to get 14 Mystic Energy. No need to round here.

## Movement

As you'd expect, this is the maximum distance a Wanderer can move in a round. Movement is used in combat/chases. Standard travel doesn't require measuring every meter. Movement is calculated like Vitality and Mystic Energy, but using Constitution and Agility as base values.

## Determination

Represents your character's willpower, ambition, and stubbornness. It lets you reroll failed checks and take extra actions in combat. More on determination in the skills section. To calculate starting Determination [DET], roll **3d6**. If you roll 4, 4, and 5, you start with 13 points. Determination is the Wanderer's driving force and is crucial. If it drops to zero, the character makes all skill checks with the Die of Misfortune [DM]. This lasts until at least one point is regained.

There are several ways to restore points. The first is rest. You can also recover after completing a major story task, like defeating an ice troll or finding a lost merchant. In these cases, Fate decides how many points are restored. Other ways include spells, potions, and bardic songs. Some not only restore points but can temporarily increase the maximum.

Since YARD is focused on Wanderer progression, you can increase your maximum determination. Every five levels, you gain two extra points—first at level five, then ten, and so on. Record all attribute, vitality, mystic energy, movement, and determination values on your Wanderer Sheet, found at the end of this book.

## Armor, Attack, and Attack Modifier

### Armor
Armor is simply the amount of physical damage a Wanderer can ignore. Its value is the sum of defense points from each piece of armor, shield, or helmet. If you have armor with 2 defense and a shield with 1, you have 3 armor points, reducing damage by that much.

Standard armor only protects against physical damage. Only special items can block magical attacks.

### Attack
Every unarmed character, regardless of age or origin, has a basic physical attack worth 1 point—fistfighting. If you equip a dagger or other weapon, your attack is set by the item's properties. For example, a dagger deals 1 damage, a short sword 2. A Wanderer with more than 70 points in Catlike Agility can also fight with two weapons.

### Damage Modifier
The stronger the Wanderer, the more physical damage they deal, no matter the weapon.

**Strength 1-2:** -3 to attack (Extremely weak, very hard to land blows).

---

**Strength 3-5:** -2 to attack (Weakling, struggles to hit effectively).

**Strength 6-8:** -1 to attack (Below average, slight edge over the weakest).

**Strength 9-12:** +0 to attack (Average strength, typical for most unspecialized characters).

**Strength 13-15:** +1 to attack (Strong, visible muscles, better in melee).

**Strength 16-18:** +2 to attack (Very strong, impressive power, true warrior).

**Strength 19-20:** +3 to attack (Superhuman strength, awe-inspiring).

---

**Strength 21-23:** +4 to attack (Heroic strength, mighty blows).

**Strength 23+:** +5 to attack (Mythic/legendary strength, destructive force).

Add the modifier to your attack value for the final damage. If fighting with two weapons, apply the modifier only to your main hand. The off hand uses the basic attack.

**Example:**
A Wanderer attacks a troll with a sword dealing 2 damage and has a +2 attack modifier. Total attack is 4, so the troll takes 4 damage if it has no armor.

Combat is covered in more detail later in the book.

## Skill Points

Once you've set your character's age and origin, you can assign base skill values and distribute points. YARD is all about freedom—there are no set professions or classes. You decide who your Wanderer is and how they grow while traveling Aleor.

### Base Values
Before distributing skill points, set their base values. By default, every Wanderer has four basic skills of their choice. Depending on your character's age, you may have one extra, based on a specific attribute. This rule reflects natural aptitudes and innate talents.

A basic skill's value is half the attribute it relies on (rounded down). For example, if a basic skill is based on Strength, its starting value is half your Strength.

All other skills start at 1.

### Point Distribution
Skill points, like attribute points, are fixed. **Every Wanderer has 18 points** to spend on any skills, adding them to base values. This fixed pool gives all players equal chances and encourages thoughtful character creation. Remember, no skill can exceed 20 points.
